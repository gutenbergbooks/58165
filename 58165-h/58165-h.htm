in our nine.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“All right. Will you
lemme pitch?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Naw; Fat’s pitcher,
’cause he’s captain; but
you can play first.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pooh! <i>Fat</i> can’t
pitch—”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I can, too. I can pitch lots better’n <i>you</i>
can, anyhow.” (This from Fat himself.)</p>

<p class='c016'>“W-well, I’ll play first, then. I don’t care.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus an adjustment was reached.</p>

<p class='c016'>A proud moment for you was it when <i>your</i>
merits as a ball-player were recognized, and
you were engaged for center-field. Of course,
secretly you nourished the strong conviction
that you were cut out for a pitcher. Next to
pitcher, you preferred short-stop, and next to
short-stop, first base. But these positions, and
pretty much everything, in fact, had been preempted;
so, after the necessary haggling, you
accepted center-field.</p>

<p class='c016'>Speedily the North Star make-up was complete,
and disappointed applicants—those too
little, too big, too late, or not good enough—were
busy sneering about it.</p>

<p><span class='small'>BILLY LUNT</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The equipment of the North Star Base-Ball
Club consisted of Fat’s “regular league” ball,
six bats (owned by various members, and in
some cases exercising no small influence in determining
fitness of the same for enlistment as
recruits), and four uniforms.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mother made your uniform.
To-day you wonder
how, amidst darning
your stockings and patching
our trousers and
mending your waists, she
ever found time in which
to supply you with the
additional regalia which, according to your
pursuits of the hour, day after day you
insistently demanded. But
she always did.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i014.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>SPUNK CAREY</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The uniform in question
was composed of a pair of
your linen knickerbockers
with a red tape tacked
along the outside seam, and
a huge six-pointed blue
flannel star, each point
having a buttonhole whereby
it was attached to a
button, corresponding, on
the breast of your waist.
And was there a cap, or
did you wear the faithful
old straw? Fat Day, you
recollect, had a cap upon the front of which was
lettered his rank—“Captain.” It seems as
though mother made you a cap, as well as the
striped trousers and breastplate. The cap was
furnished with a tremendously deep vizor of
pasteboard, and was formed of four segments,
two white and two blue, meeting in the center
of the crown.</p>

<p class='c016'>All in all, the uniform was perfectly satisfactory;
it was distinctive, and was surpassed
by none of the other three.</p>

<p class='c016'>Evidently the mothers of five of the North
Stars did not attend to business, for their sons
played in ordinary citizen’s attire of hats, and
of waists and trousers unadorned save by the
stains incidental to daily life.</p>

<p class='c016'>The North Stars must have been employed
for a time chiefly in parading about and seeking
whom they, as an aggregation, might devour,
but as a rule failing, owing to interfering house-and-yard
duties, all to report upon any one
occasion. The contests had been with “picked
nines,” “just for fun” (meaning
that there was no sting in
defeat), when on a sudden it
was breathlessly announced
from mouth, to mouth that
“the Second-street kids want
to play us.”</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Come on!” responded,
with a single valiant voice, the
North Stars.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We’re goin’ to play a
match game next Tuesday,”
you gave out, as a bit of important news, at
the supper-table.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That so?” hazarded
father, who had been flatteringly
interested in your blue
star. “Who’s the other nine?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“The Second-street fellows.
Spunk Carey’s captain and—”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Who is <i>Spunk</i> Carey?
Oh, Johnny, what outlandish
names you boys do rake up!”
exclaimed mother.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, he’s Frank Carey
the hardware man’s boy,”
explained father, indulgently.
“What’s his first name, John?”</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>CHUB THORNBURY</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I dunno,” you hurriedly owned; “Spunk”
had been quite sufficient for all purposes. “But
we’re goin’ to play in the vacant lot next to
Carey’s house. There’s a dandy diamond.”</p>

<p class='c016'>So there was. The Carey side fence supplied
a fine back-stop, and thence the grounds extended
in a superb level of dusty green, broken
by burdock clumps and interspersed with tin
cans. The lot was bounded on the east by the
Carey fence, on the south and west by a high
walk, and on the north by the alley. It was
a corner lot, which made it the more spacious.</p>

<p class='c016'>The diamond itself had been laid out, in the
beginning, with proportions accommodated to
a pair of rocks that would answer for first and
second base; a slab dropped where third ought
to be, and another dropped for the home plate,
finished the preliminary work, and thereafter
scores of running feet, shod and unshod, had
worn bare the lines, and the spots where stood
pitcher, catcher, and batter.</p>

<p class='c016'>A landscape architect might have passed
criticism on the ensemble of
the plat, and a surveyor
might have taken exceptions
to the configuration of the
diamond, but who cared?</p>

<p class='c016'>“We” had promised that
“we” would be there, ready
to play, at two o’clock, and
“they” had solemnly vowed
that “they” would be as
prompt. Tuesday’s dinner
you gulped and gobbled; in
those days your stomach was
patient and charitable almost
beyond belief in this degenerate present. It was
imperative that you be at Carey’s lot immediately,
and despite the imploring
objections of the
family to your reckless haste,
you bolted out; and as you
went you drew upon your
left hand an old fingerless
kid glove, which was of some
peculiar service in your center-field
duties.</p>

<p><span class='small'>RED CONROY</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Your uniform had been
put on upon arising that
morning. You always wore
it nowadays except when in
bed or on Sundays. It was
your toga of the purple border, and the bat that
you carried from early to late, in your peregrinations,
was your scepter mace.</p>

<p class='c016'>At your unearthly yodel, from next door
rushed out your crony, Hen Schmidt, and joined
you; and upon your way to the vacant lot you
picked up Billy Lunt and Chub Thornbury.</p>

<p class='c016'>The four of you succeeded in all talking at
once: the Second-streets were great big fellows;
their pitcher was Doc Kennedy and it wasn’t
fair, because he threw as hard as he could, and
he was nearly sixteen; Hop Hopkins said he’d
be “empire”; Red Conroy was going to play,
and he always was wanting to fight; darn it—if
Fat only wouldn’t pitch, but let somebody
else do it! Bob Leslie could throw an awful
big “in,” etc.</p>

<p class='c016'>The fateful lot dawned upon the right, around
the corner of an alley fence. Hurrah, there
they are! You see Nixie and Tom Kemp, and
Hod O’Shea, and Bob Leslie, and Spunk, and
Screw Major, and Ted Watson, and Slim Harding,
and the redoubtable Red Conroy (engaged
in bullying a smaller boy),
and others who must be the
remainder of the Second-streets.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello, kids,” you say, and
likewise say your three companions;
and with bat trailing
you stalk with free and
easy dignity into the crowd.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Where’s Fat? Who’s
seen Fat?” asked everybody
of everybody; for Captain
Fat was the sole essential
personage lacking. However, even without him,
pending his arrival the scene was one of stirring
animation.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thick and fast flew here and there the several
balls on the grounds, each nine
keeping to itself, and each boy
throwing “curves”—or, at
least, thus essaying.</p>

<p class='c016'>You yourself, brave in your
splendor of blue star and red
stripe, endeavored, by now
and then negligently catching
with one hand, to make it
plain that you were virtually
a professional.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>BOB LESLIE</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The Second-streets were as
yet ununiformed, even in sections.
But they were a rugged,
rough-and-ready set, and two
of them had base-ball shoes
on, proving that they were experts.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Here’s Fat! Here comes Fat!” suddenly
arose the welcoming cry; and appareled in his
regimentals, his cap announcing to all beholders
his high rank, panting, hot, perspiring, up
hustled the leader of the North Stars.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was time to begin.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Who’s got a ball?” demanded Umpire
Hopkins, sometimes called Harry, but more
generally known as Hop or Hoptoad.</p>

<p class='c016'>The query disclosed a serious condition.
Balls there were, but not suitable for a championship
match game. They were ten- and
fifteen-centers, as hard as grapeshot or already
knocked flabby.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Where’s your ball, Fat?” you asked incautiously.</p>

<p class='c016'>“In my pocket,” admitted Fat—a bulging
fact that he could not well deny.</p>

<p><span class='small'>PETE JONES</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“What is it? Le’ ’s see,
Fat,” demanded Captain
Spunk.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It’s a regular dollar
league,” you informed glibly;
and Fat, with mingled pride
and reluctance, extracted it
from the pocket of his
knickerbockers,—peeled it,
so to speak, into the open,—and
handed it out for inspection.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gee!” commented Spunk, thumbing it, and
chucking it up and catching it. “It’s a dandy!
Come on, kids; here’s a ball!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But if you use my ball, you’ve got to give
us our outs,” bargained Fat,
dismayed.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>HOD O’SHEA</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“G’wan!” growled Red
Conroy. “Don’t you do it,
Spunk. ‘Tain’t goin’ to hurt
his old ball any.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Awed by the ever-belligerent
Red, Fat submitted to the
customary lot by bat. Spunk
tossed a bat at him, and he
caught it, with an elaborate
show of method, about the
middle; then with alternate
hands they proceeded to cover
it upward to the end.</p>

<p class='c016'>The last hand for which there was space was
Fat’s; by no manner of means could Spunk
squeeze his grimy fist into the two inches left.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We’ll take our outs,” majestically asserted
Captain Fat; whereat whooped shrilly all the
North Stars, and quite regardless of their affiliations
whooped shrilly the spectators also, composed
of small brothers and a few friends about
equally divided between the contestant nines.</p>

<p class='c016'>Some preliminaries were yet to be gone
through with. Doc Kennedy was protested
because he pitched so swift.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, <i>I</i> won’t throw hard,” he assured bluffly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Of course not! <i>He’s</i> easy to hit,” chorused
his companions.</p>

<p class='c016'>Then, in view of the fact that Billy Lunt had
a sore finger, as evidenced by a cylinder of
whitish rag (which he slipped off, obligingly,
whenever solicited), it was agreed that he be
allowed to catch the third
strike on the first bounce.</p>

<p class='c016'>A foul over the back-stop
fence was out; a like penalty
was attached to flies over the
boundary walks.</p>

<p class='c016'>And now, turning hand-springs
and otherwise gamboling
exultantly, the North Stars
scattered to their respective
positions.</p>

<p class='c016'>Away out in center-field
you prepared to guard your
territory. You bent over, with
your hands upon your knees, and ever and
anon you spat fiercely, sometimes upon the
ground and sometimes into
your kid glove. This was
the performance of the players
upon the town’s nine,
the Red Stockings and evidently
greatly added to their
efficiency.</p>

<p class='c016'>Besides, on the edge of
the walk just back of you
were sitting and swinging
their slim legs two little
girls, whom it was pleasant
to impress.</p>

<p class='c016'>Overhead the sun was
blazing hot, but not to you;
underfoot the dust from a
long dry spell lay choking
thick, but not to you; a “darning-needle”
whizzed past, and you scarcely ducked, although
he might be bent upon sewing up your ears.
Your work was too stern to admit of your
noticing sun, or dust, or mischievous dragon-fly.
So you spat into your glove, replaced your
hands on your knees, and waited.
“Hello, Johnny!” piped one of the little girls;
but you deigned not to make answer.</p>

<p class='c016'>To right and to left were the Kemp boys,
with their hands upon <i>their</i> knees; and before
were the infielders, with their hands likewise
upon <i>their</i> knees; that is, all
except the pitcher.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Play ball!” gruffly bade
the umpire.</p>

<p class='c016'>Captain Spunk advanced
to the slab.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gimme a low ball,” he
ordered, sticking out his bat
to indicate the proper height
that would meet his wishes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Captain Fat rolled the
ball rapidly between his
palms, and thus having imparted
to it what he fondly
believed was a mysterious
twist, hurled it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“One ball!” cried the
umpire.</p>

<p class='c016'>Captain Spunk banged the slab with his bat.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, gimme a low ball over the plate!” he
urged.</p>

<p class='c016'>Again the pitcher rubbed twist into the
sphere, and out in center—field you hung upon
his motions.</p>

<p class='c016'>“One strike!” declared the umpire, and a
great shout of derision arose
from the North Stars and
their adherents.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Captain Fat smiled wickedly:
the unfortunate batter
was being fooled by those
deceptive curves.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What did you strike at
that fer—’way up over yer
head!” censured Red Conroy,
angrily.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Darn it! gimme a good low ball! You’re
’fraid to!” challenged Captain Spunk.</p>

<p class='c016'>Whack! He had hit it. Right between
Short-stop Chub’s legs it darted, and you and
left-field together stopped it, but too late to
prevent the runner’s reaching first.</p>

<p class='c016'>Chub came in for a tongue-lashing from all
sides; and then Spunk stole second, and Billy
threw over Bob’s head there (at the same time
throwing the rag cylinder, also, half-way to the
pitcher’s box), and you desperately fielded the
ball in, and Fat got it, and threw over Hod’s
head at third, and to the wild cries of “Home!
Home! Sock her home!” Nixie got it and
threw it at Billy; but nevertheless Spunk,
spurred on by the frantic exhortations of his
fellows, panting “Tally one!” crossed the slab.</p>

<p class='c016'>Triumphantly cheered the Second—streets, and
busily flashed the jack-knife of each spectator
as he cut a tally-notch in a stick.</p>

<p class='c016'>Billy ran forward and reclaimed his precious
rag.</p>

</div>

<p class='c016'>Ten more tallies were recorded before the
half-inning closed. The
whole North Star nine was
red from running after the
ball and disputing with the
umpire—disputes into
which everybody on the
ground had earnestly entered.
Red Conroy had
threatened to “smash” several
North Stars, you
among them; Catcher
Billy had long since witnessed his cylinder
trampled into the diamond and ruined; Captain
Fat had tried all the most deadly twists
in his repertoire; when, finally, hot and irritated,
you and yours had come in.</p>

<p class='c016'>And now, reminding Pitcher Doc that he had
promised not to throw hard, Billy stepped to
the plate, to hit, to reach first, daringly to steal
second, foolishly to be caught between bases,
successfully to dash past Red, who endeavored
to trip him, and out of the confusion safely to
attain third, whence soon he galloped home,
and tallied.</p>

<p class='c016'>“’Leven to five!” declared the sprawling
spectators, every one a score-keeper, to each
other, as at last in scampered the Second-streets
and out lagged the North Stars.</p>

<p class='c016'>You had not batted, and you were relieved,
because batting was a great responsibility, with
your critical fellows advising you, and castigating
you whenever you missed.</p>

<p class='c016'>In this their next inning the Second-streets
made fourteen! Notwithstanding Fat’s utmost
art, as signified by his various occult motions,
they batted him only too easily, and kept infield
and outfield chasing all over the lot. Yet he
angrily refused to “let somebody else pitch.”
Bob Leslie even attempted to take the ball
away from him and forcibly trade places—a
mutiny which called forth an “Aw, g’wan an’
play ball, you kids!” from the waiting batter,
Screw Major.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why don’t you fellows stop some of them
grounders, then?” retorted Fat to derogatory
accusations. “Gee whiz! You don’t stop
nothin’!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus it resolved into a question of whether ’t
was not stopping, or having o’ermuch to stop,
that brought disaster.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was your turn. You faced the mighty
Doc. He threw, and the ball came like a
cannon—shot, you thought.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You’re throwin’ swift!” you remonstrated.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Shut up!” sneered Red, from third. “Who’s
a—throwin’ swift? Give him one in the head,
Doc!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Blindly you struck, and the condemnations
of your mentors squatting anear raked you fore
and aft.</p>

<p class='c016'>Quite unexpectedly you hit it. You did not
know where it went, but you scudded for
first.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Second! Second!” gesticulating frantically,
bawled all your companions, coaching you onward.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Second! Second!” bawled with equal fervor
your opponents, coaching the fielder.</p>

<p class='c016'>You grabbed off your cap,—it is strange
how much faster a boy can run when thus assisted,—and
madly dug for second. Praise
be! There you were, beating the ball, which
appeared from a mysterious somewhere, by a
hair’s-breadth.</p>

<p class='c016'>You stuck to second, meanwhile dancing and
prancing to tantalize the pitcher, until another
hit forwarded you to third, for which you slid,
not because it was absolutely necessary to slide,
but because the slide was a part of the game.</p>

<p class='c016'>Here, at third, while you were dreaming of
the home slab, and the honor of admonishing,
hoarsely, for the information of the world,
“Tally me!” Red, the ruthless, abruptly gave
you a shove, hurling you from position.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Quick, Doc!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c016'>Doc responded with the ball.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Out!” decreed the umpire.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But he shoved me! He shoved me off the
base!” you shrieked.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Who</i> shoved yer? I didn’t, neither! G’wan!
Yer out; don’t you hear the empire?” snarled
back Red.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You did, too!” you asserted.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He did, too! No fair! He shoved him like
everything!” vociferated all the North Stars and
their supporters.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You’re out! You’re out!” gibed the Second-streets,
from catcher to farthest fielder.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Out!” majestically pronounced the umpire
again.</p>

<p class='c016'>Slowly, obedient to the higher authority represented
in the freckled-faced Hoptoad, you
walked down the base-line. In some way, apparently,
you had disgraced your blue star,
begrimed from your manful slide, for “Why
did you let him touch you?” accused your
comrades.</p>

<p class='c016'>The idea! How could you help it, you’d
like to know.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>It was the first half of the fifth inning. The
score, according to the notches on the sticks,
was fifty to thirty-one, in favor of the Second-streets.
Those spectators who had exercised
the forethought to start with long sticks were in
clover, while those with short sticks were having
hard work to find space for all the runs.</p>

<p class='c016'>The sun was not so high as when the game
began, neither were your spirits. Much excited
chasing, and much strenuous yelling, had told
upon you. Your face was streaked; your hair
was in dank disorder; your blue star flapped,
and your waistband sagged behind, mourning
for departed buttons. You were what mothers
style “a perfect sight.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The air had been rent by incessant wranglings.
Tom Kemp and Screw Major had indulged
in a brief rough-and-tumble, because
Screw had thought that Tom had purposely
trodden upon his sore toe, Screw injudiciously
being barefoot.</p>

<p class='c016'>Every member of the North Stars had committed
egregious errors, and had been tartly
excoriated by all hands. You yourself had
muffed, and had thrown the ball seven ways
for Sunday.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fat was still doggedly clinging to pitch, and
Doc was throwing swift. The two little girls,
once your admirers, had gone away in disgust.
And the score, as remarked above, was fifty to
thirty-one.</p>

<p class='c016'>Tug McCormack it was who picked out one
of Fat’s wonderful twisters and batted it over
your head. After it you raced, deliriously discarding,
of course, your sadly abused cap, that
you might gain in speed. Behind you bellowed
friends and enemies, and around the bases was
pelting Tug.</p>

<p class='c016'>Where was the ball—oh, where <i>was</i> it! It must
have struck a can or stick, and bounded crooked.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hurry! Hurry!” exhorted the Second-streets
to Tug.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Home! Home! Home with it!” exhorted
the North Stars to you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pick it up now and look for it afterward!”
yelled second base.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What’s the matter with you? It’s right
there!” yelled Captain Fat.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Darn it! Ain’t you got eyes?” yelled left-field,
and “You darned fool!” yelled right-field,
converging from each side.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lost ball!” you screamed, tramping hither
and thither to show that you spoke truth.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lost ball!” screamed the Kemp brothers.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lost ball! Lo-o-ost ba-a-all!” chimed in
the North Stars generally.</p>

<p class='c016'>But Tug had scored.</p>

<p class='c016'>“No fair!” objected Billy Lunt. “He’s got
to go back to second. Lost ball! Don’t you
hear? Lost ball!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I don’t care. ’Tain’t my fault,” confuted
Tug.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Course not!” said Captain Spunk, scornfully.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But you can’t come in on a lost ball; can he,
Hop?” appealed Billy to the umpire.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Shut up! What yer talkin’ about? Course
he can,” affirmed Red.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Shut up yourself!” hotly bade Billy. “<i>You</i>
aren’t runnin’ the game. Can he, Hop?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I dunno!” confessed Umpire Hop, digging
with his toe at a mound of dirt.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ya-a-a-a-ah!” sneered Red at the discomfited
Billy.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, he can’t just the samee!” resolved
Captain Fat. “It’s my ball.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Just the samee, he can!” contradicted Captain
Spunk. “It’s my father’s lot.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lost ball! Lo-o-ost ba-a-all!” you and
Nixie and Tom had been calling as unceasingly
as the tolling of a bell; and continuing the discussion,
which abated never, the members of
both nines, and the spectators, who also were
the score-keepers, scattered over the ground to
assist in the search.</p>

<p class='c016'>It seemed that no effort or artifice, even to
lying down and rolling where the weeds were
thick, could bring to light that ball, until suddenly
piped little Jamie Watson:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Red Conroy’s runnin’ off!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“He’s got it, I bet you! Hey! Stop, thief!”
hailed Tom, quickly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Drop that ball! Stop, thief!” swelled the
chorus.</p>

<p class='c016'>But down the alley legged Red, and disappeared
over a fence. Evidently he had “got
it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Wait till I catch him!” promised Fat, in
deep, wrathful tones.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>You ought to have been very tired that evening
at the supper-table, but you were not, for
in those days you never were tired, save momentarily.
However, you still were green and
brown in spots that your hurried washing had
not touched, and dusty in other sections that
your equally hurried brushing had omitted.
Your face was as red as a setting sun, and you
were full of experiences—a fulness that did
not in the slightest impair your appetite.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Who beat?” had inquired mother, as you
had come trudging in.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We only played four innin’s, and they were
fifty and we were thirty-one, and then Red
Conroy stole the ball,” you explained.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, who beat?” asked father, at the table.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nobody did,” you stated, this solution having
occurred to you. “We didn’t finish, ’cause
Red Conroy he ran off with the ball.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But what was the score when this happened?”
pursued father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Fifty to thirty-one—but it was only four
innings,” you answered, with a wriggle.</p>

<p class='c016'>“And who made the fifty?” persisted father,
ignoring mother’s warning frown.</p>

<p class='c016'>“They—they did,” you blurted; and then you
hastened to add, “But they’re lots bigger’n us.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch02' class='c006'>YOU AT SCHOOL</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c015'>NOW and again you dream one special
dream. Suddenly you find yourself back
in school. There you are, a great awkward
man, squeezing into the old familiar seat and
essaying some strangely mixed-up lesson. And
about you are the mates of yore, who have not,
apparently, grown a bit.</p>

<p class='c016'>Although they seem not to notice anything
peculiar in your presence, nevertheless your
position is decidedly embarrassing to you. You
feel that you must mind the teacher, of course,
and yet you cannot, for the life of you, get that
lesson! What a gawk you are! And how in
the world are you ever going to stand this
awful reversal?</p>

<p class='c016'>Then you awaken, and with a sigh of relief
discover yourself, in the gray of the morning,
safely brought down to date, in your bed.</p>

<p class='c016'>And once more you sigh, but this time not in
relief. It is a sigh tenderly laid by retrospection
upon the urn of the past.</p>

<p class='c016'>In your dream the schoolroom was unusually
small, and your seat was constricted to the
extent that your knees were tightly pressed
against the under side of the desk, while the
edge of it was creasing your stomach. However,
probably it was not that the room and the
seat had shrunk; it was that you had expanded
beyond limits.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the days when it was quite proper that
you should be in school, the room was extensive
indeed, and the seat was ample for innumerable
wriggles. For instance, it permitted you to
slide down until, reaching forward with your
two feet, you engaged the insteps of Billy Lunt,
and hauling back with all your might, deliciously
held him so that he could move only
from the waist upward. Abruptly you released
him, and his feet dropped with a big thump
that made the teacher frown.</p>

<p class='c016'>This seat and desk was your little state, surrounded
by other little states similar to it, and
all ruled by “teacher,” who, like some Pallas
Athena, from her Olympia platform surveyed
and appraised, bade and forbade.</p>

<p class='c016'>Your state was bounded on the rear by
Snoopie Mitchell’s, on the front by Billy Lunt’s,
on the right and the left by a river, or aisle,
such as at regular intervals divided the country
and opened up the interior to travel.</p>

<p class='c016'>This was a country of equal suffrage; some of
the states were feminine, some were masculine.
All, but especially the masculine, were liable to
internal troubles, produced through external
agencies.</p>

<p class='c016'>As example, the bent pin was an indefatigable
disturber of the peace. It would intrude at the
slightest opportunity, and the first thing that
you knew it was in your midst—almost literally.
The canny explored their seat of state
(or their state of seat, if preferred) with their
hands, before venturing to settle for the pursuance
of routine duties.</p>

<p class='c016'>Poor, long-suffering Billy Lunt (yet poor you,
as well; for although you are behind him, the
mischievous Snoopie is behind <i>you</i>)! Down he
plumps, and up he jumps with a wild “Yow!”
at which your whole being exults even while
your heart beats uneasily. You descry, where
he is frantically clutching, the steely glint of <i>it</i>!</p>

<p class='c016'>“Will, sit down!” thunders the teacher.</p>

<p class='c016'>This, forsooth, is adding insult to injury; for
had he been able to sit, assuredly he would not
thus have arisen. In a moment he cautiously,
gingerly obeys, at the same time holding into
sight the pin, as
though it were a
monstrosity, so that
all must see.</p>

<p class='c016'>To “yow” very
loudly, and to expose
the cause with
great ostentation to
the utmost publicity,
was the resort of
every pin-afflicted
petty ruler.</p>

<p class='c016'>“John, did you
put that pin on
Will’s seat?” demands
the teacher.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id008'>
<img src='images/i042.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>TEACHER</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The wave of sniggers
that had swelled
during Billy’s antics
ebbs and dies, and
all the world listens
for your reply.</p>

<p class='c016'>With the frankest astonishment—astonishment
that ought to have completely turned suspicion—you
have been gazing at the Lunt
performance. Has he gone crazy? What can
ail him? Who could have done it to him?</p>

<p class='c016'>This simulated wonder is <i>your</i> part of the
program—your voluntary part, that is.</p>

<p class='c016'>“John, I ask you if you put that pin there,”
reiterates the persistent examiner, judge, and
executioner.</p>

<p class='c016'>And now that the glamour of the deed has
faded, how you wish that you had <i>not</i>! For
the voluntary part of the program is always
followed by an involuntary part.</p>

<p class='c016'>All in all, the possession of a state in these
united states is fraught with peril. So much is
prohibited. It is unlawful to have a poor memory
or a dull brain or a careless tongue; it is
unlawful to carry on intercourse, either written
or oral or by signs, with neighbor states; it is
unlawful to import articles for consumption—such
as cinnamon drops, or lemon drops, or
jujube, or licorice; while to import gum is a
capital offense.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nevertheless, gum is imported and secreted
by being stuck to the inner surface of the desk-top,
thence to be peeled off at recess and at
closing-time, and chewed. Sometimes it is forgotten,
and the janitor contemptuously scrapes
it to the floor for his dust-heap, or a successor
to you rapturously finds it. Whenever one
moves into a new state, one runs a pleasurable
chance of discovering a gum-deposit.</p>

<p class='c016'>The principal penalties are “stayin’-after-school,”
“gettin’-sent-home,” and “lickin’s.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It is the close of a day in this despotic monarchy,
and the despot has tapped her bell for
books to be put away. The next tap will mean
dismissal; but between taps comes the allotment
of punishments.</p>

<p class='c016'>You reflect—and regret. There was once
during the day when you asked Billy Lunt if
he had “the first example.” You whispered it
very circumspectly, but the unruly sibilants in
your tones somehow spread into the open.
“Teacher” pricked her ears in your direction,
and with her pencil she apparently made a
memorandum upon her ready slip.</p>

<p class='c016'>Was it your name she jotted? Or was it
Billy’s? He was in the act of showing you his
slate. You are ungenerous enough to hope that
it was Billy’s.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the meantime you hold your breath (as,
in similar anxiety, round about you do your
compatriots, save the goody-goodies and the
“teacher’s pets,” whose names never are read)
and listen.</p>

<p class='c016'>The kids are going swimming; the signal has
been passed along. You have set your heart
upon going with them. Consequently, never
have you felt so repentant, so full of high resolves
and the best intentions, and your appealing
gaze might well have moved a stone,
to say nothing of a
teacher.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Those whose
names I read may
remain,” she announces
calmly:
“Sam Jessup, Dolly
Smith, Horace
Brown, Leonard
Irving, Patrick Conroy,
Olga Jansen,
<i>John Walker</i>!”</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i045.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“STAYIN’-AFTER-SCHOOL”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Crushed, you hear
the second tap;
freed, the others rise;
out they file, but you
stay behind—you
and a few companions in misery scattered at
wide intervals through the nearly deserted room.</p>

<p class='c016'>From without sound gay shouts and laughter,
growing fainter and fainter, and dying in the
distance.</p>

<p class='c016'>You are marooned.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Take your books and go to work at some
lesson!” orders the teacher.</p>

<p class='c016'>Maybe, if you strive hard and obediently, she
will let you go soon. Some of the prisoners
shuffle angrily, and rebelliously bang things
about in their desks; but you promptly open
your geography, and hoping that her eye is
noting you, pretend to apply yourself to its
text. Silence falls, broken only by the measured
<i>tick-tock</i> of the clock on the wall.</p>

<p class='c016'>Presently you glance up. Five minutes have
passed. “Teacher,” with eyes fastened upon
her desk, is engaged in correcting a quantity of
exercises. She seems to pay not the slightest
attention to the clock.</p>

<p class='c016'>You give a weary little shuffle—your first—and
turn a page.</p>

<p class='c016'>Two more minutes. Even yet you could
catch the kids. How good you are! But,
blame it, what is the sense, if she does not notice?</p>

<p class='c016'><i>Tick-tock, tick-tock</i>, repeats the monitor on
the wall, checking off the wasted moments.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ten minutes! Is she going to keep you all
night? Doesn’t she see what time it is getting
to be? You make a lot of noise, to warn her;
but she never looks. For all that is evident,
she might have forgotten the existence of you
and everybody else. She simply goes on reading
and marking.</p>

<p class='c016'>Twelve minutes. You raise your hand. You
keep it raised. You shuffle some more, and
you cough, and you shuffle again.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, John, what is it?” she vouchsafes in
a tired voice.</p>

<p class='c016'>She has heard you all the time, but you don’t
know it. Neither do you know that she has
been reading you while reading scrawly exercises.</p>

<p class='c016'>“How long do I have to stay?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Until I tell you you may go.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Fifteen minutes. You throw off your hypocritical
sainthood, and you lapse into your
genuine boiling, raging self. Darn her. Darn
the teacher! Darn the old teacher! What does
she care about going swimming? She just wants
to keep a fellow in! You’ll show her sometime!
And you shuffle and scrape and kick and bang,
and she apparently pays not the least heed
to it.</p>

<p class='c016'>The darned old thing (although, in truth, she
is <i>not</i> old, save in boy eyes and in boy ways)!</p>

<p class='c016'>Twenty minutes! Darn the—</p>

<p class='c016'>“You may go now, Johnny.”</p>

<p class='c016'>She cuts your condemnatory sentence right
in the middle; and not finishing it, you hastily
throw the geography into your desk, and make
for the door. On your way you dart a glance
at her, wondering if she knows what names you
have been calling her. She smiles at you, and
you feel rather sheepish.</p>

<p class='c016'>After all, you have time for a swim, delightfully
prefaced by throwing mud at the whole
crowd in ahead of you.</p>

<p class='c016'>Staying-after-school is a penalty for misdemeanors;
for crimes there is “gettin’-sent-home”—not
bad at all until you get there,
furnishing, as it does, a vacation—and “lickin’s,”
which sounds worse than it really is.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lickin’s” don’t hurt half the time. Never
would a boy admit, outside, that a licking hurt;
he “bellered just for fun”! The fact is, lots of
the kids declared they had rather take a licking
than be kept after school, for a licking was
soon over, and then you were through.</p>

<p class='c016'>But by virtually unanimous vote the kids all
asserted that they had rather be licked, any
day, or stay after school for a whole month,
than “speak.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It is Friday afternoon—a fateful Friday
when sashes and squeaky shoes and slicked
hair and significantly arrayed chairs herald
“speaking day.” And you are among the elect,
as testify your red tie without and your uneasy
heart within.</p>

<p class='c016'>Early the books are put away, and with the
clearing of the desks are cleared also the
metaphorical decks.</p>

<p class='c016'>A bustle is heard at the threshold, and in
come the first of the visitors—a pair of mothers.
Whose mothers they are is speedily indicated
by the flaming ears of a very red girl and a very
red boy, at whom, as the intelligence spreads,
all the school looks.</p>

<p class='c016'>The mothers rustle chairward, settle into
place, and smilingly wait.</p>

<p class='c016'>Another bustle! More visitors! Out of the
corner of your eye you slant one apprehensive
glance in their direction, and then you quickly
turn your head the other way. It is <i>your</i>
mother. You felt it even before Snoopie gave
you a painful telegraphic kick. She has come.
She said that she might. You have been alternately
hoping and fearing. Now you know.</p>

<p class='c016'>In impish ecstasy Snoopie keeps dealing you
irritating jabs. <i>His</i> mother <i>never</i> comes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Teacher moves from the platform and seats
herself at one side. It is the final preparation.
In her hand she holds the list of prospective
performers, and somewhere adown it is your
name.</p>

<p class='c016'>You would give worlds to know just where—just
whom you follow. The chief agony
attached to the afternoon is in the racking uncertainty
as to when one will be called upon.
The nearer the top of the list, the better, for
thereafter one will be free to revel in the plight
of others. But to be reserved until toward the
last, and to sit in a cold sweat through most of
the afternoon—ah, this is the suspense that
fairly curls one’s toes!</p>

<p class='c016'>Listen! She is going to read.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Harry Wilson. Recitation: ‘George Nidiver.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>Amid oppressive silence Harry clumps up the
aisle, and stumbling miserably on the platform
step receives a tribute of grateful titters. Teacher
taps rebukingly with her pencil, and frowns.
Harry bobs his head for a bow, and, white and
blinky, proceeds:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Men have done brave deeds,</div>
      <div class='line in3'>And bards have sung them well:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>I of good George Nidiver</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“In California mountains</div>
      <div class='line in3'>A hunter bold was he:</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Keen his eye and sure his aim</div>

    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A little Indian boy</div>

      <div class='line in3'>The hunter’s meal to share.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>You would bask the more unrestrictedly in
Harry’s presence did you not see in him your
unlucky self; and while he is speaking you
feverishly go over and over parts of your own
piece.</p>

<p class='c016'>As Harry approaches the end, his pace grows
faster and faster, until at a gallop he dashes
through the concluding stanza, offers a second
bob in lieu of other punctuation, long lacking,
and clumps back to his seat, where he grins
rapturously, as if he had at last had a tooth
pulled.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“NINA GOTTLOB.<br />COMPOSITION:‘KINDNESS’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>How you envy Harry’s light-heartedness as
with bated breath you strain
your ears for the next announcement!</p>

<p class='c016'>This proves to be “Nina
Gottlob. Composition:
‘Kindness.’” After Nina
somebody else, not you, is
summoned; and thus name
after name is read, with you
hanging on by your very
eyebrows, before, at the most
unexpected moment, come to
you, like the crack o’ doom,
the words: “<i>Johnny Walker</i>.
Recitation: ‘The Soldier of
the Rhine.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>The teacher looks at you expectantly. Snoopie
trips you as you tower into the aisle. Oh, the
tremendous distance which you, all feet and
arms, traverse in getting to the platform! You
mount; and here you stand, a giant, and bow.
Away below, and stretching into space remote,
are faces of friends and enemies—the ones
(mostly those of little girls) gravely staring at
you, and the others twisted into hideous grimaces
calculated to make you laugh. As in a dream
you witness your mother gazing up at you with
beaming, prideful, but withal anxious eye.</p>

<p class='c016'>Very vacant-headed, you drag from your
throat a thin stranger voice which says:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>There was lack of woman’s nursing, there was dearth of woman’s tears,”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>and mechanically maintains the narrative for
some moments, and then on a sudden peters
out!</p>
<p class='c016'>You cast about for something with which to
start it up again, but you light upon nothing.
All the faces in front watch you curiously,
amusedly, grinningly. Helpless, you look in
the direction of Billy Lunt, upon whose desk,
as you passed, you had laid the book, that he
might prompt you, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c016'>Billy has lost the place, and is desperately
running his forefinger adown the page.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘Tell my mother that her other sons—’”
presently he assists, in husky tones; and, as if
set in motion by the vibrations, your voice,
with an apologetic “Oh, yes,” goes ahead once
more.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>

<p class='c019'>And so forth.</p>

<p class='c016'>Several times it stops again, but Billy sits
alert to fill in each hiatus; and vastly relieved
in mind you triumphantly regain your seat,
only to ascertain, to your disgust, that you are
the last of the afternoon’s victims.</p>

<p class='c016'>Escape from this despotism of school, with its
penalties and speaking and other disagreeable
features, which combined to outweigh any possible
advantages or profit, was always engaging
in prospect, although apt to be unsatisfactory
in realization.</p>

<p class='c016'>You longed to be a man. You wondered
how it would seem to walk about paying no
attention whatsoever to the old bell. Were the
people outside the school aware of their fortunate
state? Gee!</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It was an odd fact that in the week the finest
and most interesting days, out of doors, habitually
were Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
Thursday, and Friday—and Sunday. The
best fishing invariably came on Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday—and Sunday.
You always felt the most like having fun
on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday,
Friday—and Sunday. What was measly little
Saturday, eclipsed so by these other days all-glorious
without!</p>

<p class='c016'>If your folks were only like Snoopie’s folks
you could play hooky once in a while. Snoopie
asserted that his father “didn’t care.” Yours
did—very much.</p>

<p class='c016'>The sole recourse which remained for you
was being sick; and insomuch as the real article
was annoyingly scarce with you, it was requisite
that you manufacture some substitute.</p>

<p class='c016'>’Tis a spell of beautiful weather—the kind
of weather that came, as aforesaid, on Mondays,
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, Fridays—and
Sundays. Your feet lagged to school, and
your heart kept pace with them. Now you are
idling in your seat, utterly unable to work. A
vagrant bee hums in through an open window,
and hums out through another. A woodpecker
drums, as on a sounding-board, upon the spire
of the Congregational church. A blue jay
screams derisively, like an exultant truant,
among the elms arching the street in front. All
these things upset you, stirring as they do the
<i>Wanderlust</i> of boyhood.</p>

<p class='c016'>The sky never has been so blue, the grass
and the trees never so green, the sunshine never
so golden, nor the air so mellow, as at recess.</p>

<p class='c016'>You hate school. You don’t want to go in.
Snoopie volunteers:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let’s play hooky this afternoon, and go
fishin’!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“My father won’t let me,” you declare.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, come on. He’ll never know,” scoffs
Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>But he would, just the same.</p>

<p class='c016'>The only chance you have is to be sick.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is over-late to be sick to-day, for there is a
ball game after school, and you are to take
part. If you are sick this evening, when the
sports of the day are finished, your mother will
accuse you of having played too hard, and such
a notion would turn your attack into a boomerang.</p>

<p class='c016'>You will be sick in the morning.</p>

<p class='c016'>Accordingly, with great languidness you flop
into your chair at breakfast, and carefully
dawdle over your food. You endeavor not to
eat, although, as luck would have it, the menu
is one of which you are particularly fond. But
so much the better.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, John, you aren’t eating! Isn’t the
breakfast good?” exclaims mother, instantly
noting.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes, ’m.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then why don’t you eat it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come, eat your breakfast, Johnny,” supplements
father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I don’t want to,” you plead.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Don’t you feel well?” asks mother anxiously.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not very.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Where do you feel sick?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, my head aches.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Give me your hand.”</p>

<p class='c016'>You lay it in hers, and she thoughtfully holds
it and scrutinizes you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I do believe that the boy has a little fever,
Henry,” she says to father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Maybe he’s caught cold. Better have him
keep quiet to-day,” suggests father. “I’ll do
his chores this morning.”</p>

<p class='c016'>You really begin to feel ill, the word “fever”
has such a portentous sound. And you thereby
submit the easier to being stowed upon the sofa
against the wall, your head upon a pillow and
the ready afghan over your feet and legs.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There’s so much measles about now; don’t
you think we ought to have Dr. Reese come in
and look at him?” remarks mother to father,
in that impersonal mode of conversation, like
an aside, which seems to presuppose that you
have no ears.</p>

<p class='c016'>“N-n-no,” decides father. “I’d wait and see
if he doesn’t feel better soon.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In his eye there is a twinkle, at which mother’s
face clears, and they exchange glances which
you do not comprehend.</p>

<p class='c016'>The first bell rings. The chattering boys
and girls on their way to school pass the house.
But no school for you, you bet! And the last
bell rings. As you hark to some belated, luckless
being scampering madly by, you hug yourself.
Let the blamed old bell bang; you don’t
care!</p>

<p class='c016'>The summons dies away in a jarring clang.
Here you are, safe.</p>

<p class='c016'>You remain prone as long as you can, but
your sofa-station at last grows unbearably irksome.
It is time that you pave the way for
more action. Mother is bustling in and out of
the room, and you are emboldened to hail her:</p>

<p class='c016'>“I want to get up.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Not yet,” she cautions. “Lie quiet and try
to go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Sleep!</p>

<p class='c016'>She places her cool palm, for a moment, upon
your forehead.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I don’t think that you’ve got much fever,
after all,” she hazards. “But lie still.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Out of policy you strive to obey for a while
longer, but every muscle in your eager body
rebels. You twist and toss; you stick up one
knee, and then the other, and then both at
once; and finally a leg dangles to the floor over
the outer edge of your unhappy bed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I want to get up. I feel lots better,” you
whine.</p>

<p class='c016'>“No,” rebukes mother, firmly. “Papa said
that you were to keep quiet.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But I will be quiet,” you promise.</p>

<p class='c016'>“W-well, only you must not go outdoors,”
she warns.</p>

<p class='c016'>However, anything to be released from that
narrow sofa; so off you roll, and apply yourself
further to the delicate business of gaining health
not too rapidly, yet conveniently.</p>

<p class='c016'>It appears, however, that, according to some
occult line of reasoning, “a boy who is not well
enough to do his chores or go to school is not
well enough to play”! The more vigorous you
grow, the more this maxim is rubbed into you.</p>

<p class='c016'>When the afternoon has fairly set in, you
have become so very, very well that in your
opinion you may, without risk of a relapse,
play catch against the barn—which, of course,
would be a preliminary warming up, leading to
meeting the kids after school. You propose the
half of your project to your mother; but she
sees only impropriety in it, and proffers that if
you really need exercise you may finish uncompleted
chores!</p>

<p class='c016'>After school you hear the other boys tearing
around; but you must “keep quiet”! The only
consideration won by your suddenly bursting
health is intimation from mother that unless you
moderate, you will be deemed strong enough to
stand a “good whipping.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In fact, the whole bright day proves more of
a farce than you had anticipated. What is the
use of being sick, if you are not allowed to have
any fun?</p>

<p class='c016'>By bedtime your mysterious malady is by
common consent a thing of antiquity and in
the morning you go to school.</p>

<p class='c016'>The time arrives when you go no more.
You yourself are now of that free company
whom you have so envied. Yet it does not
seem such a wonderful company, after all.
You find that your position still has limitations.
When you had lived within, it was permitted
you to pass and mingle with the life without;
but now that you have chosen the without, not
again may you pass within, save in dreams.</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c006'>CHUMS</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c015'>DON’T you remember when, your mother
laughingly dissenting, your father said
that you might have him, and with rapture in
your heart and a broad smile on your face you
went dancing through the town to <i>get</i> him?</p>

<p class='c016'>There was quite a family of them—the old
mother dog and her four children. Of the
puppies it was hard to tell which was the best;
that is, hard for the disinterested observer. As
for yourself, in the very incipiency of your hesitation
something about one of the doggies appealed
to you. Your eyes and hands wandered
to the others, but invariably came back to
him.</p>

<p class='c016'>With the mother anxiously yet proudly looking
on, you picked him up in your glad young arms,
and he cuddled and squirmed and licked your
face; and in an instant the subtle bonds of
chumship were sealed forever. You had chosen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I guess I’ll take this one,” you said to the
owner.</p>

<p class='c016'>And without again putting him down you
carried him off, and home.</p>

<p class='c016'>How unhappy he appeared to be, during his
first day in his new place! He whined and
whimpered in his plaintive little tremolo, and
although you thrust a pannikin of milk under
his ridiculous nose, and playmates from far
and near hastened over to inspect him and
pay him tribute, he refused to be appeased.
He simply squatted on his uncertain, wabbly
haunches, and cried for “mama.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i066.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>You fixed him an ideal nest in the barn;
but it rather made your heart ache—with that
vague ache of boyhood—to leave him there
alone for the night, and you went back many
times to induce him to feel better. Finally, you
were withheld by your father’s: “Oh, I wouldn’t
keep running out there so much, if I were you.
Let him be, and pretty soon he’ll curl up and
go to sleep.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i067.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Sure enough, his high utterances ceased, and
nothing more emanated from him. Whereupon
your respect for your father’s varied store of
knowledge greatly increased.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the morning you hastened out before
breakfast to assure yourself that your charge
had survived the night; and you found that he
had. He was all there, every
ounce of him.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i068a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>What a wriggly, rolly, awkward
lump of a pup he was, anyway! How
enormous were his feet, how flapping his ears,
how whip-like his tail, how unreliable his body,
how erratic his legs! Yet he was pretty. He
was positively beautiful.</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i068b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Your mother could not resist him. Can a
woman resist anything that is young
and helpless and soft and warm?
With pictures in her mind of ruined
flowers and chewed-up household
furnishings, she gingerly stooped down to pet
him; and at the touch of his silky coat she
was captive.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nice doggy!” she cooed.</p>

<p class='c016'>Upon which he ecstatically endeavored to
swallow her finger, and smeared her slippers
with his dripping mouth, and
peace was established. Thereafter
mother was his stoutest champion.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i068c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>The christening proved a matter requiring
considerable discussion. When it comes right
down to it, a name for a dog is a difficult
proposition. It may be easy to name other
persons’ dogs, but your own dog is different.</p>

<p class='c016'>Your father and mother, and even the hired
girl, proposed names, all of which you rejected
with scorn, until, suddenly, into existence
popped a name which came like an old friend.
You seized it, attached it to the pup, and it just
fitted. No longer was he to be referred to as
“it,” or “he,” or “the puppy.” He possessed
a personality.</p>

<p class='c016'>The hired girl—and in those days there
were more “hired girls” than “domestics”—was
the last to yield to his sway. She did not
like dogs or cats about
the house; dogs caused
extra-work, and cats got
under foot.</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i069.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>But upon about the
third morning after his
arrival you caught her
surreptitiously throwing
him a crust from among
the table leavings that
she was bearing to the alley; and you knew that
he had won her. Aye, he had won her. You
also found out that he much preferred a crust
thus flung to him from the garbage to any
carefully prepared mess of more wholesome
food.</p>

<p class='c016'>Probably this subtle flattery pleased the girl,
for although her grimness never vanished, once
in a while you descried her smiling through it,
in the course of a trip to the back fence while
the puppy faithfully gamboled at her skirts in
tumultuous expectation of another fall of manna.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i070.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>He grew visibly—like the seed planted by
the Indian fakir. Enormous quantities of
bread and milk he gobbled, always appearing
in fear lest the supply should sink through the
floor before he had eaten his fill. Between
meals his body waned to ordinary size; but,
mercy! what a transformation as he ate! At
these times it swelled and
swelled, until, the pan empty,
the stomach full, its diameter
far exceeded its length.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i071a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>However, there was a more permanent growth
than this, as you discovered when you awoke
to the fact that his collar was too tight for him.
So you removed it, and in the interval between
removing the old and getting the
new properly engraved, his neck
expanded fully an inch. The old
collar would not meet around it
when, as a test, you experimented.</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i071b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>So good-by to the collar of puppyhood, and let
a real dog’s collar dangle about his neck. The
step marked the change from dresses to trousers.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i071c.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Not only bread and milk and other mushy
non-stimulating stuff did he eat,
but he ate, or tried to eat, everything
else within his reach. Piece-meal,
he ate most of the door-mat.
He ate sticks of wood, both
hard and soft, seemingly preferring a barrel-stave.
He ate leaves, and stones, and lumps
of dirt, and the heads off the double petunias
and the geraniums. He ate a straw hat and a
slipper. He attempted the broom and the
clothes-line, the latter having upon it the week’s
wash, thus adding to the completeness of the
menu.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i072.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>In his fondness for using his uneasy teeth,
new and sharp, he would have eaten you, did
you not repeatedly wrest your anatomy from
his tireless jaws.</p>

<p class='c016'>As it was, you bore over all your person, and
particularly upon your hands and calves, the
prints of his ravaging, omnivorous mouth.</p>

<p class='c016'>Your mother patiently darned your torn
clothing, and submitted to having her own
imperiled and her ankles nipped; while your
father time and again gathered the scattered
fragments of his evening paper, and from a
patchwork strove to decipher the day’s news.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i073.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>And “Look at him, will you!” cried the hired
girl, delighted, indicating him as he was industriously
dragging her mop to cover.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>Well, like the storied peach, he “grew, and
grew.” Speedily he was too large for you to
hold in your arms, and although he insisted
upon climbing into your lap, you could no more
accommodate him there than you could a huge
jellyfish. He kept slipping off, and was all legs.</p>

<p class='c016'>He fell ill. Ah, those days of his distemper
were anxious days! He wouldn’t eat, and he
wouldn’t play, and he wouldn’t do anything
except lie and feebly wag his tail, and by his
dumbness place upon you the terrible burden
of imagining his condition inside.</p>

<p class='c016'>Here came to the rescue the old gardener,—Uncle
Pete, black as the ace of spades,—who
gave you the prescription of a nauseous yet
simple remedy which you were compelled lovingly
and apologetically to administer three
times a day; and behold, the patient
was cured. You didn’t
blame him any for rising from his
bed; and you wouldn’t have
blamed him any for cherishing
against you a strong antipathy,
in memory of what you forced down his throat.
But he loved you just as much as ever.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i074.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Now he developed roaming propensities,
which took the form of foraging expeditions.
Once he brought back a five-pound roast of
beef, his head high in the air, and buried it in
the garden. Diligent inquiry exposed the fact
that the beef had been intended by a neighbor
for a dinner for a family of six, and for subsequent
relays of hash, etc. Your mother, with
profuse apologies, promptly sent over a substitute
roast, the original being badly disfigured.</p>

<p class='c016'>Upon another occasion he conveyed into the
midst of a group consisting of your mother and
father, and the minister, guest of honor, sitting
on the front porch, a headless chicken, still
quivering. You were commanded to return the
fowl, if you could; and after making a canvass
of the neighborhood you found a man who,
having decapitated a choice pullet, and having
turned for an instant to secure a pan of hot
water, was mystified, upon again approaching
the block, to see, in all his level back yard, not
a vestige, save the head, of the feathered victim.
When you restored to him his property, he
laughed, but not as if he enjoyed it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Along with his foraging bent, the dog acquired
a passion for digging. One day he accidentally
discovered that he <i>could</i> dig, and forthwith he
reveled in his new power. Huge holes marked
where he had investigated flower-beds or had
insanely tried to tunnel under the house.</p>

<p class='c016'>He grew in spirit as well as in stature. He
had his first fight, and was victorious, and for
days and days went around with a chip on his
shoulder, which several lickings by bigger dogs
did not entirely remove. Out of that first fight
and the ensuing responsibility of testing the
mettle of every canine whom he
encountered came dignity, poise,
and courage. His puppy days
were over. He had arrived at
doghood.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i076a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>What sweet years followed!
It was you and the dog, the dog and you, one
and inseparable. When you whistled, he came.
All the blows you gave him for his misdemeanors
could not an iota influence him against
you. Other comrades might desert you for
rivals of the moment, but the dog never! To
him you were supreme. You were at once his
crony and his god.</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i076b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>When you went upon an errand, the dog was
with you. When you went fishing or swimming
or rambling, the dog was
with you. When you had
chores to do, the dog was
your comfort; and when you
were alone after dark he
was your protection. With
him in the room or by your
side you were not afraid.</p>

<p class='c016'>When you had been away for a short time,
who so rejoiced at your return as the dog?
Who so overwhelmed you with
caresses? Not even your
mother, great as was her love
for you.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i077a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Did you want to frolic? The dog was ready.
Did you want to mope? He would mope, too.
He was your twin self, and never failed.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>The sun and you were up together on that
summer morning, and the dog joined you as
soon as you threw open the barn door. Almost
you had caught him in bed, but not quite,
although he had not had time to shake himself,
and thus make his toilet.</p>

<p class='c016'>Intuition told him that such an early awakening
meant for him a day’s outing, and he leaped
and barked and wagged
his glee.</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i077b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>You worked with a
will, and when the hired
girl summoned you to
breakfast the kitchen
wood-box had been
filled, and all the other
jobs laid out for you had been performed, and
you were waiting. So was the dog, but not for
breakfast. He was waiting
for <i>you</i>.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i078a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>How he gobbled down the
scraps constituting his meal;
never pausing to chew, and
frequently desisting in operations in order to
run around the house and investigate lest, by
hook or crook, you might be slipping off without
his knowledge!</p>

<p class='c016'>Now your boy companion’s whistle sounded
in front; and hastily swallowing your last mouthfuls,
disregarding your mother’s implorations
to “eat a little more,” with the paper packages
containing your lunch of bread and butter and
sugar and two hard-boiled eggs stuffed into
your pockets, sling-shot
in hand, out you
scampered; and the
dog was there before
you.</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i078b.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Along the street you,
gaily hied, the three of you, until the over-arching,
dew-drenched elms and maples ended, and the
board walk ended, and you were in the country.</p>

<p class='c016'>Civilization was behind you; all the world of
field and wood was ahead.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i079a.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />

<p class='c016'>Don’t you remember how balmy was the
air that wafted from the
pastures where the meadow
larks piped and the bobolinks
rioted and gurgled?
Don’t you remember how
the blackbirds trilled in the
willows, and the flicker screamed in the cottonwoods?
Don’t you remember how you tried
fruitless shots with your catapult, and how the
dog vainly raced for the gophers as he sped
like mad far and wide?</p>

<p class='c016'>Of course you do.</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>

</div>

<p class='c016'>The morning through you trudge, buoyant
and tireless and fancy-free;
fighting Indians and bears and
wildcats at will, yet still unscathed;
roving up hill and
down again, scaling cliffs and
threading valleys, essaying
perilous fords, and bursting
the jungles of raspberry-bushes;
and you guess at noon, and sprawl in the
shade, beside the creek, to devour your provisions.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i080.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>During the morning, some of the time you
have seen the dog, and some of the time
you have not. Where you have covered miles
he has covered leagues, and
more than leagues; for a
half-hour he will have disappeared
entirely, then, suddenly,
right athwart your
path he hustles past, in his
orbit, as though to let you
know that he is hovering about.</p>

<p class='c016'>While you are eating, here he comes. He
seats himself expectantly before you, with lolling
tongue, and gulps half a slice of bread, and
looks for more. A dog’s only selfishness is his
appetite. He will freeze for you, drown for
you, risk himself in a hundred ways for you,
but in the matter of food he will seize what he
can get and all he can get, and you must take
care of yourself.</p>

<p class='c016'>The lunch is finished, and the dog, after
sniffing for the crumbs, sinks down with his
nose between his paws, to indulge in forty uneasy
winks until you indicate what is to be the
next event upon your program.</p>

<p class='c016'>Presently, however, with a little whine of
restlessness, he is off.</p>

<p class='c016'>You are off, too. It is the noon siesta. The
air is sluggish. The birds and the squirrels
have relaxed, and the woods are subdued. The
strident <i>scrape</i> of the locusts rises and falls, and
the distant shouts of men in harvest-fields float
in upon your ear. You are burning hot; but
the water of the creek is cool—the only cool
thing in your landscape. A swim, a swim!
Your whole being demands that you go in
swimming.</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i081.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>The dog already has been in a number of
times, as his wet coat
has evidenced. Feverishly
following the
winding stream, envying
the turtles as they
plunge in, upon your
approach, you arrive
at a bend where the
banks are high, and
the current, swinging
against them, halts and
forms an eddy. Here the depths are still and
dark and beckoning.</p>

<p class='c016'>To strip those smothering garments from
your sunburnt body is the work of but an
instant, and in you souse, not without some
misgiving as to possible water-snakes and snapping
turtles, but spurred by a keen rivalry as
to which shall “wet over” the first.</p>

<p class='c016'>Oh, the glorious, vivifying thrill that permeates
you as you part the waters!</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i082.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>The dog again! From the bank he surveys
the proceedings with mingled curiosity and
apprehension, and finally, with a whine of
excitement, dashes into the shallows and makes
for your side. You are neck-deep, and he is
swimming. His hair feels queer and clammy
against your skin, and his distended claws raise
a welt upon your bare shoulder as he affectionately
tries to climb on top of you. You duck
him, and grab at his tail; and convinced that
you are in no immediate danger, he plows for
the shore, where he contents himself with
barking at you.</p>

<p class='c016'>Despite the dog’s remonstrances and entreaties,
you sported in that blissful spot until the
sun was well down the west; now you frolicked
in the cool eddy, now you dabbled amid the
ripples of the shoals just below, and now you
dawdled on the warm, turfy banks. The dog
stretched himself by your clothing and went to
sleep.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i083.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>At length, with blue lips and chattering teeth,
and a ring of mud encircling your mouth, marking
where years later the badge of manhood
would appear, you donned your clothes, and,
weak but peaceful, to the rapture of the dog
started homeward.</p>

<p class='c016'>He did not know that you were going home.
When you had left home in the morning he did
not know that you were coming here. He did
not care then; and he does not care now. You
are doing something, and he is a partner in it;
and that is sufficient.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i084.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Homeward, homeward, through woods and
across meadows where the birds were gathering
their evening store and voicing their praises and
thanks because the sun had been so good.
Homeward, homeward, not talking so much as
when your faces were turned the other way, not
frisking so much as formerly, and with the dog
trotting soberly near your heels.</p>

<p class='c016'>You were dead tired, the three of you.</p>

<p class='c016'>When you were about a block from the house,
the dog pricked up his ears and trotted ahead,
to wait for you at the gate. While you ate your
supper he slept on the back porch; and after his
own supper he slinked straight into the barn,
to bed.</p>

<p class='c016'>And soon, he in his nest up-stairs in the barn,
you in your nest up-stairs in the house, alike you
were slumbering; for neither could possibly
sleep sounder than the other.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>Years sped by, and the dog remained an
integral part of the household. Such a quaint,
quizzical, knowing old chap, with an importance
ridiculous yet not unwarranted, with an
individuality all his own, thoroughly doggish,
but well-nigh human. He was affectionate
toward the rest of the family, but you he adored.
He might occasionally bluffly growl at others,
but never at you. You could make him do
anything, anything. To him you were perfect,
omnipotent, and with you at hand he was happy.</p>

<p class='c016'>You emerged from the grammar school into
the high school. Then arrived that summer
when you went to visit your aunt and uncle,
and stayed three weeks. You remember the
visit, don’t you?</p>

<p class='c016'>And when you disembarked at the station on
your return, and your mother was there to meet
you, even while kissing her you looked for the dog.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Where’s Don?” you asked.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, John,” reproved your mother, as so
often she had jokingly done before, “do you
think more of seeing your dog than of seeing me?”</p>

<p class='c016'>This silenced you.</p>

<p class='c016'>But when you had entered the yard, and next
the house, ungreeted by the familiar rush and volley
of barks, you were impelled to inquire again:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Where <i>is</i> Don, mother?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Mother put her arm around you, and laid
her lips to your forehead; and even before she
spoke you felt what was coming.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Johnny dear, you never will see Don any
more,” she said; and she held you close while you
sobbed out your first real grief upon her breast.</p>

<p class='c016'>When you could listen she told you all—how
they had found him, lifeless, where he had
crawled under the porch; how they had buried
him, decently and tenderly, where you might
see his grave and put up a headboard; how they
had kept the news from you, so that your visit
should not be spoiled; and how, all the way
from the depot, her heart had ached for you.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus the dog vanished from your daily life,
and for weeks the house and yard seemed very
strange without him. Then, gradually, the
feeling that you were to come upon him unexpectedly
around some corner wore off. You
grew reconciled.</p>

<p class='c016'>But to this day you are constantly encountering
him in dreamland. He hasn’t changed, and
in his sight apparently you haven’t changed.
You are once more boy and dog together. This
leads you to hope and to trust—indeed, to
believe—that, notwithstanding your mother’s
gentle admonition, you <i>will</i> see him again, in
fact as well as fancy, after all.</p>

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c006'>IN THE ARENA</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c015'>WHEN a boy retorted with the direct
challenge, “An’ you da’sn’t back it!”
it was a case, if you did not wish to lose caste,
of your either taking the aggressive or effecting
some honorable compromise.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was difficult to explain to an outsider, to
one not in sympathy with the duello, the deep
significance of “da’sn’t back it.” You felt the
term, but you could not elucidate it, save, to
some extent, by example; you yourself, with a red
spot on your forehead, a scratch on your nose,
a torn collar to your waist, a rent in your knickerbockers,
and a proud spirit in your bosom,
being the example.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, I <i>should</i> like to know what you were
fighting about,” declared your mother, holding
you prisoner at her knee while she stitched your
collar so as to make you presentable for supper.</p>

<p class='c016'>You squirmed, realizing the task before you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, we were playin’, an’ Ted he tripped
me, an’ I said he did it on purpose (an’ he did,
too), an’ he said he didn’t an’ I said he did, an’
he said I was a liar an’ da’sn’t back it, an’ I
went to back it, an’ he hit me, an’—”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But what <i>is</i> to ‘back it’?” interrupted your
mother.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, to back it—to back it, you know.
He said I da’sn’t <i>back it</i>, an’ I had to or else
I’d be a coward, an’ he hit me, an’ I hit him,
an’—”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But how could you back being a liar? I
don’t understand.”</p>

<p class='c016'>She was a darling mother, yet at times surprisingly
dense.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I <i>did</i> back it, though, just the same.” That
ought to be exposition enough, and you galloped
on with your narrative: “An’ I hit him, an’ he
hit me right on the forehead,—but it didn’t
hurt,—an’ I—an’ then we got each other
down, an’ I was gettin’ on top, an’ then the
kids pulled him off, an’ a man came by an’
wouldn’t let us fight any more. Ted’s ten, an’
I’m only nine.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus, with a little valorous touch, you finished
your story. This much you accomplished, even
though you evidently had failed in bringing your
mother to a clear perception of “backing it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Father looked at you inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What’s that, John? Fighting! With
whom?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“John had a fight this afternoon; have you
heard about it?” asked your mother, gravely,
of your father at supper.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘SAY, SPECK SAYS HE CAN LICK YOU’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>It was a portentous moment.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ted Watson. He tripped me on purpose
an’ nearly made me fall when I was runnin’, an’
then he told me I da’sn’t back it. But we
didn’t fight long, ’cause a man came by an’
stopped us.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You can see he scratched his nose, and his
collar was torn almost off his shirt,” supplemented
your mother.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I tore <i>his</i> collar, too—an’ I bet he’s goin’
to have a black eye,” you hastened to state, in
palliation.</p>

<p class='c016'>“W-w-well, I’m astonished, John!” asserted
your father, very solemnly.</p>

<p class='c016'>You fastened your eyes upon your plate, and
could think of nothing to say in rebuttal. You
had stalked homeward a hero, fondly expecting
that your parents would be proud of you, who,
only nine, had combatted a boy of ten, and were
“gettin’ on top”; but witness how they had
wet-blanketed you!</p>

<p class='c016'>“I told him that he ought to have refused to
fight, and it would have made the other little
boy ashamed,” informed your mother.</p>

<p class='c016'>“By all means,” approved your father.</p>

<p class='c016'>Coming from your mother, the advice, while
of course absurd, had not seemed so strange;
after all, she never had been a boy, and girls
didn’t fight; but your father’s traitorous acquiescence
goaded you to desperation.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Did <i>you</i> ever da’sn’t back it when you were
a boy like me, papa?” you appealed; and
although you were not fully cognizant of the
fact, you had him hip and thigh.</p>

<p class='c016'>He glanced at your mother, and had you
been looking at him instead of still eying your
plate, you would have seen his mouth twitch in
a funny way.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You do as mama says. She’s always right,”
he answered, and you had a dim suspicion that
he was begging the question.</p>

<p class='c016'>The little encounter between Ted and you
was described much more quickly than it had
occurred. The duello as practised in your corps
did not admit of undue precipitancy in falling
to blows. A certain amount of palaver was
obligatory first—an exchange of witticism and
defiance, beyond which, as often as not, one did
not proceed.</p>

<p class='c016'>When Ted had tripped you, and you had
angrily accused him of having done it on purpose,
he had denied it just as angrily:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Didn’t, neither!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Did’t, either!” said you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Didn’t, neither!” said he.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Did’t, either!” said you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Didn’t, neither. You’re a liar!” said he.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Did’t, either. You’re another!” said you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You’re another ’nother!” said he.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You’re twice as big as anything you can
call me!” said you—a crusher, and quite
unanswerable.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You’re twice as big as that, an’ you da’sn’t
back it!” said he, also scoring a point.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“YOU LET YOUR FOLLOWING FEEL YOUR MUSCLE”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“He says you da’sn’t back it! Ya-a-a-a-ah!
he says you da’sn’t back it!” gibed the boys
about you, glorying in the crisis.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ted and you were now uncomfortably in the
center of a circle which was ever being increased
by the jubilant cries of “Fight! Fight!” which
summoned spectators from all quarters.</p>

<p class='c016'>“G’wan an’ back it! You can lick him!”
urged your supporters.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, he’s ’fraid to! He’s ’fraid to!” scoffed
your rivals.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ted and you, grimy fists doubled, not knowing
exactly what to do, faced each other.
Neither of you wanted to fight. Fighting was
being forced upon you. You were to amuse
the pitiless crowd.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I ain’t, either, afraid,” you asserted sullenly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I wouldn’t let him trip <i>me</i> up that way, you
bet,” inspired a friend on your right, boldly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“An’ call me a liar an’ everything!” added a
friend on your left.</p>

<p class='c016'>Oh, how solicitous of your honor were they
who were not to do the fighting!</p>

<p class='c016'>“He <i>is</i> a liar if he says I tripped him on
purpose,” stoutly reiterated Ted, slightly qualifying
his former blunt statement.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You’re another!” you returned. “Anyhow,
it <i>looked</i> as if you tripped me on purpose.”</p>

<p class='c016'>You, likewise, were hedging a mite.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There! He called <i>you</i> a liar, too!” admonished
the circle to Ted.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then he’s another, an’ he da’sn’t back it,”
responded Ted, grimly performing his duty.</p>

<p class='c016'>This harmless verbal fencing might have been
continued up to the very present, and the ethics
of the duello not have been violated, had not
some over-zealous enthusiast pushed Ted and
you together, with the result that, in fending
each other off, you, according to the eager
verdict of the highly observant critics, “backed
it,” and he hit you, simultaneously; whereupon,
not seeing anything else left to do, at each other
you went like a couple of jumping-jacks, until
(fortunately, you held, for Ted) the approach
of the man caused him to be removed from on
top of you.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“YOU ... ARE THE INVENTOR OF A PECULIAR, IRRESISTIBLE BLOW”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Flushed, excited, and disheveled, you went
your way; and flushed, excited, and disheveled,
Ted went his way. Throughout your route,
you and your babbling escorts, with many a
“Gee!” and “Darn!” discoursed upon what
you had done, and what Ted had not done,
and what would have happened had the fight
lasted only a minute longer.</p>

<p class='c016'>Loudly you wrangled with them as to which
got the worst of it, quite blind to the fact, which
now you are free to acknowledge, that the one
who got the worst of it was your mother, for
she had to mend your clothes.</p>

<p class='c016'>She was always getting the worst of it. She
was the unlucky non-combatant.</p>

<p class='c016'>The duello produced the best of feeling between
Ted and you.
Fights were for mutual
benefit. Swelling
dignity and biceps
so demanded expression
that they could
not forever be gratified
by merely playfully
poking chums
in the ribs.</p>

<p class='c016'>Therefore it is plain
why, when a friend
mischievously reported
to you, “Say,
Speck says he can
lick you,” it was all
that was required.
Like to a strutting cockerel who hears a distant
crow, you bristled in answer.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He can’t, either. I can lick him with one
hand tied behind my back.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Fast flew the news to Speck, and Speck
promptly resented the slur, as he should. The
boys of the neighborhood were pleased.</p>

<p class='c016'>Now you, and likewise Speck, are the objects
of much flattering attention. You let your
following feel your muscle, and they let you
feel theirs, and you are firmly convinced that
yours is the hardest. Also, you are convinced
that you have a great knack at fisticuffs, and
are the inventor of a peculiar, irresistible blow
which you deliver, the knuckle of the middle
finger carefully protruded, under your warding
left arm. More or less secretly you have demonstrated
it while “fooling” with your companions.</p>

<p class='c016'>You can chin yourself six times, and you are,
in valor and strength, a boy wonder.</p>

<p class='c016'>Your companions favor you with adulation
to a degree compatible with their own self-respect;
for most of them, too, are boy wonders.</p>

<p class='c016'>Well as Speck and you are satisfied with
bravado and careful avoidance of each other,
it is inevitable that you meet.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There’s Speck—see? Come on; <i>you</i> ain’t
afraid of <i>him</i>!”</p>

<p class='c016'>You have committed yourself too far for
graceful retreat, and in the midst of your crowd
you advance boldly to join Speck and his
crowd.</p>

<p class='c016'>The rival clans come together and mingle,
but Speck and you pretend not to see each
other.</p>

<p class='c016'>“John says he can lick you, Speck!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Yes, you have said so, but it was under
provocation of, presumably, a direct challenge
from him. However, the duello does not thrive
on explanations, and Speck and you are in the
hands of your friends.</p>

<p class='c016'>The all-engaging topic has been broached.
Speck apparently does not hear. Maybe the
matter will be dropped. But no.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He says he can lick you with one hand—aw,
Speck!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“He can’t, though,” defends Speck.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Speck says he can’t, either,” obligingly
announces his backers.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, he can, I bet you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Bet you he can’t.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“He’ll show him whether he can or not.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Huh! I’d just like to see him once!”</p>

<p class='c016'>You find yourself hustled forward and set
against Speck, who in like manner has been
pressed to the front. Your hands hang limply
by your side; so do Speck’s. You feel very tame
and pale and artificial; not a whit mad; not a
whit like fighting. The pugnacity is your
seconds’.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will if I want to.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Don’t you stand that!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There!” you say, tapping him gently on the
breast.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There!” he answers, tapping you a little
harder.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There!” you return, tapping him harder still.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There!” he retaliates, tapping you yet harder.</p>

<p class='c016'>Then with a final “There!” that breaks
through all restraint, and amid shrill, rapturous
cheers, two pairs of arms begin to whirl
with wild rapidity, the sole thought of their
owners being a blind offense according to
hit-who-hit-can rules.</p>

<p class='c016'>The engagement did not last long. A horrified
and meddlesome old lady interfered, and
after informing you both many times that
“little boys shouldn’t fight,” your temperature
down again to normal, she sent you off with
your disappointed encouragers, while she conscientiously
watched you out of sight.</p>

<p class='c016'>Up to date the question whether you can
lick Speck or Speck can lick you is no further
settled. Henceforth the spirit of amity prevailed
between you. Mettle had been proved,
the fight had been fought, and now somebody
else must furnish entertainment.</p>

<p class='c016'>Although victory, actual or prospective, of
course never was doubtful (either you were
winning, or the other fellow was winning, according
as to which did the telling), at some
times it appeared to a spectator more decisive
than at others.</p>

<p class='c016'>You were feeling very spunky that noon when
amid your preserves you descried a stranger
boy; but civilly you challenged him. One may
witness two bluff but wary fox-terriers thus
approach each other, accost, and investigate.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello!” you wagged; that is, said.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello, yourself!” wagged he.</p>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“TWO PAIRS OF ARMS BEGIN TO WHIRL”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Say—what’s
your name?” you
inquired, as you
had every right
to do.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Puddin’ tame;
ask me again, an’
I’ll tell you the
same,” he replied
insolently.</p>

<p class='c016'>At the unmerited
rebuff you
stiffened.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Better not
give <i>me</i> any of
your sass!” you
growled.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pooh! What’ll <i>you</i> do!” he growled back.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I’ll show you what I’ll do.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You couldn’t hurt a flea.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I couldn’t, couldn’t I?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Naw, you couldn’t, ‘couldn’t I.’”</p>

<p class='c016'>Walking circles around each other, after this
fashion you and he sowed crimination and recrimination,
while larger and larger waxed an audience
hopeful of seeing them spring up as
blows.</p>

<p class='c016'>Only when the flurry came did you discover
too late how much taller and stronger and older
than you he was. Your bleeding nose showed
this to you; and cowed and weeping, you retreated
in bad order.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I’ll tell my big brother, an’ <i>he</i>’ll fix you!”
you howled threateningly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, he ain’t got any big brother,” jeered the
heartless crowd, who saw no pathos in your
abused organ.</p>

<p class='c016'>That was true; you had none.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I’ll tell my father, then,” you wailed angrily—another
empty boast; and still sniffling and,
fearsomely gory, with the handkerchiefs of yourself
and your one faithful companion quite exhausted,
you reached the haven of a friendly
pump.</p>

<p class='c016'>Yet you had not been whipped—not exactly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Got licked, didn’t you?” unkindly commented
various friends and enemies.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I didn’t, either!” you asserted, indignant.
“I had to quit ’cause my nose was bleedin’. It
takes more’n him to lick me.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“He gave you a bloody nose just the samee.”</p>

<p class='c016'>You would not admit so much as that.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He didn’t, either; he never touched my nose.
It bleeds awful easy. It bleeds sometimes when
you just <i>look</i> at it—don’t it, Hen?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch05' class='c006'>THE CIRCUS</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c015'>CIRCUS was in the air. Circus had been
in the air for some time, exhaled broadcast
by village billboards and fences, and the
fronts and exposed sides of numerous buildings.
Breathing this atmosphere, small wonder is it
that you and your compatriots were circus-crazy,
and cared not who knew it.</p>

<p class='c016'>The circus came. From half-past four, in
the pink of the dawn, until nightfall, it was
given your unremitting aid and presence—the
two in one. Your fellows were equally assiduous.
Nothing that might be done outside the
tent was left undone; nothing that might be
inspected was overlooked. As for the inside,
some of your friends penetrated, like yourself,
with the escort of father, mother, uncle, brother,
or neighbor; some, like Snoopie Mitchell, “snuk
under”; but all were there.</p>

<p class='c016'>The circus went. Behind it remained, as
evidences of its visit, the still contagious bills;
one more welt in the shape of a ring, added to
the other similar but older welts upon the face
of that historic pasture patch; and a burning
ambition in the breast of every youth.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i112.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Now witness each back yard a training-school
for tumblers, trapeze-experts, weight-slingers,
jugglers, bareback-riders, and tight-rope walkers.
Right among the foremost were <i>you</i>.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hen and me are goin’ to have a circus,”
you vouchsafed importantly at the family board.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hen and who?” queried father, quizzically.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hen and <i>me</i>.” Why fuss with grammar,
when greater things were impending? It is not
what one says, but what one does, that counts:
at least, according to your copy-book at school,
in which you had laboriously written, “Deeds,
not Words,” twenty times.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We’re goin’ to give it in Hen’s barn, and
you and mama’ve got to come.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I don’t know that I can get away, having
just been to one,” stated father, gravely. “I
didn’t expect another so soon.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>I</i>’ll come,” comforted mother. “When is
it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“We dunno yet; but everybody that gets in
has got to bring ten pins—and bent ones don’t
count, either. Hen’s mother’s comin’.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do you think we can spare ten pins?”
inquired mother of father.</p>

<p class='c016'>The idea seemed preposterous to you, with
a whole cushion bristling on the bedroom
bureau; but nevertheless you awaited, with
considerable anxiety, father’s reply.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I guess so,” answered father. “But members
of the performers’ families ought to go in
free. How’s that, John?”</p>

<p class='c016'>You shook your head decidedly. Such a
suggestion must be nipped in the bud.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>Naw</i>, sir! Everybody has to pay!”</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>There was no dearth of performers; they
were as plenty as ball-players, and you had an
embarrassing number of volunteers, who offered
themselves as soon as the news of your circus
spread through the neighborhood.</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie Mitchell was among the earliest.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Say, I’ll be in your circus,” he proposed.
“I can skin the cat twice, an’ do the giant’s
swing, an’ turn flip-flops both ways, an’—”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i114.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Pooh! That’s nothin’. So can I,” scoffed
Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You can’t, neither!” contradicted Snoopie.
“Le’ ’s see you, now.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen obligingly cut a caper.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, gee!” sneered the redoubtable Snoopie,
in high scorn. “That ain’t no hand-spring!
That’s a cart-wheel! Anybody can turn a cart-wheel!
Aw, gee! Lookee here! Here’s the
way <i>you</i> did.” He demonstrated. “Lookee!”—and
again he demonstrated.—“<i>That’s</i> a
reg’lar hand-spring.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well—I can do it, only my back’s lame,”
faltered the abashed Hen. “And I can skin
the cat, too. Can’t I, John?”</p>

<p class='c016'>You nodded.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But I’ve skun it twice, an’ John’s seen me,
haven’t you, John?” trumpeted Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>You nodded confirmation to this, also.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yep,” you said; “he did, Hen; truly he
did.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Without changin’ hands?” insisted Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Of course,” asserted Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie was accepted.</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom Kemp and Nixie Kemp were organizing
a circus of their own, but consented to be in
yours if you’d be in theirs.</p>

<p class='c016'>Over Billy Lunt occurred almost a fight, because
a rival company set up the claim that he
had promised them; but by bribe of a jews’-harp
he was won to your side. Fat Day was
asked chiefly on account of his pair of white
rats, which would prove a valuable addition
to the prospective menagerie.</p>

<div  class='figleft id013'>
<img src='images/i116.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“If you’ll lemme be
clown, I’ll bring ’em,”
consented Fat.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But John he’s clown,”
explained Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>This was true. Before
advertising for talent,
Hen had preempted ringmaster,
and you, clown,
as the choice positions,
which was only the part
of ordinary discretion.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I tell you, Fat: you
can be fat boy, and wiggle your ears and make
folks laugh,” suggested Hen, eagerly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Uh-uh! If I can’t be clown, I won’t be
nothin’,” declared Fat. “An’ you can’t have
my white rats, either.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen looked at you dubiously.</p>

<p class='c016'>“All right. I don’t care. Let him,” you
assented moodily, kicking up the dirt with your
toe.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You can be one clown, Fat, and John’ll be
the other,” proffered Hen, with fine diplomacy.
“And you and he can make b’lieve fight, and
things. We ought to have two clowns, you
know.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But the glowing picture of the two clowns
did not appeal to Fat’s imagination.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Naw,” he whined. “If anybody else is
goin’ to be clown, <i>I</i> don’t want to.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Accordingly Fat was awarded the clownship,
and you said you’d just as lief be contortionist,
which he <i>couldn’t</i> be.</p>

<p class='c016'>Clowns were really a drug on the market.
Not a boy but aspired to the chair, and it required
no little tact to steer them into other lines.</p>

<p class='c016'>The organization, as finally effected, was as
follows:</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen, ringmaster.</p>

<p class='c016'>You, contortionist.</p>

<p class='c016'>Billy, who could hang by his toes and do
other things on the trapeze, and who, as a
tumbler, could stand on his head (sometimes)
without touching his hands.</p>

<p class='c016'>Tom, who could do things on the trapeze,
and who was a juggler learning to keep three
balls going in the air.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nixie, who also could do things on the trapeze,
and who was an aspiring (and at times
almost an <i>ex</i>piring) clothes-line walker.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fat, who could wiggle his ears.</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie, indefatigable, marvelous, a genius
of one suspender, whom a special providence
seemed to have endowed.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i118.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Menagerie (in prospect): Don, your dog;
Snap, the Kemps’ dog; Lunt’s cat; Fat’s white
rats; Hen’s “bantie” rooster.</p>

<p class='c016'>A rehearsal was not only unnecessary, but
impracticable as well; that is, a rehearsal in
company. However, individual practice went
on daily, and not a member of the troupe but
emulated the most daring feats produced under
Barnum’s tent, as could be testified to by the
most casual observer, and by that emergency
Band of Mercy, the Sisterhood of Mothers,
adepts with court-plaster and needle.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, John!” sighed your own mother.
“How <i>do</i> you manage to tear your pants so!
This is the third time, and in the very same
place! Can’t you be careful?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i119.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“I’m practisin’ splits,” you offered.</p>

<p class='c016'>“‘Splits’?” repeated mother, densely ignorant.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes. You straddle, and you keep on straddlin’,
and see how near you can come to sittin’;
and you’ve got to get up again without usin’
your hands. There was a man and woman and
little girl and boy no bigger ’n me in the circus
that could go clear down till they touched. I
can ’most do it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“John!” exclaimed mother, in horror. Then
she noted something else. “And your waist,
too!”</p>

<p class='c016'>You condescended to explain farther.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes; I tumbled off the trapeze when I was
swingin’. Look here!” Pulling up your sleeve
you proudly exhibited an elbow. It was an
elbow that earned you distinction among your
comrades, although Nixie had a knee which he
boasted was “skinned” much worse.</p>

<p class='c016'>The date of the circus was set for Wednesday
afternoon, and that morning a show-bill, tacked
upon the Schmidt front gate-post, announced
it to all the world.</p>

<p class='c016'>All the little girls of the neighborhood were
by turns flippant and wheedling, and boys,
your rivals, were positively libelous in their
derision.</p>

<p class='c016'>Schmidt’s barn-loft had long been empty of
hay and tenanted chiefly by spiders and rats
and mice. It was a splendid place for the
circus, a commodious tent being lacking.</p>

<p class='c016'>Throughout the morning you and Hen, assisted
by your associate performers, labored like
fury, a profound secrecy enveloping your operations.
No one except Billy’s small brother
(he having sacredly been sworn “not to tell,”
an investiture of confidence that gave him a
decided strut) was admitted to gaze upon the
advance proceedings; but the noise of hammering
and other preparations was carried afar,
together with a cloud of dust out of the open
loft door.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Where was your parade?” asked father at
noon, when, hot and excited and somewhat
grimy, you feverishly attacked your well-heaped
plate.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Didn’t have any,” you mumbled. “Fat
wouldn’t let us take his rats out on the street,
’cause he said they’d get away; and, besides,
we didn’t have wagons enough for all the
cages.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But to the timid inquiries of the little girls
during the morning you had replied boldly:</p>

<p class='c016'>“There ain’t goin’ to be any parade. Of
course there ain’t! Do you s’pose we’re goin’
to let everybody see what we got?”</p>

<p class='c016'>At half-past one o’clock the public was invited
to ascend. The ticket-taker was Billy’s small
brother aforesaid, and never was receiving-teller
of a national bank more vigilant or particular.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You didn’t gimme only nine!” he would
accuse shrilly. “You didn’t, either! You
didn’t, either! You’ve got
to gimme another pin or
you sha’n’t come in!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I gave you ten! I did!
I did! Didn’t I, Susie?
You dropped one.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Peace would be restored
by the number being made
up through the prodigality
of a friend, and the ruffled
damsel would pass in.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i122.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Your mother and Hen’s
mother, and your hired
girl, and the Schmidt
hired girl arrived together,
their appearance causing
a flurry and contributing to the circus the importance
due it. Mrs. Schmidt panted heavily
after the toilsome climb,—she was a large,
short-winded woman,—and, choosing a seat
near the door, fanned herself vigorously.</p>

<p class='c016'>A few boys, after poking their heads above
the floor and grinningly surveying the scene,
ended by trooping in with apologetic and bantering
mien. But in the main the spectators
were feminine.</p>

<p class='c016'>The amphitheater, constructed of boards laid
across boxes, in two lines, slowly filled. As the
etiquette of the profession required that circus-performers
not be seen until the time for their
act, you and Hen and the other stars remained
in close seclusion, huddled in the dressing-room—the
far corner, veiled by a calico curtain
(from the Schmidt clothes-press) tacked to convenient
rafters. Meanwhile the public might
enjoy the collection arrayed at one side of the
loft, where was conspicuously exposed the sign,
in white chalk: “Managerie.”</p>

<p class='c016'>In a soap-box with slats across the front
wrathfully crouched Lunt’s gaunt gray Thomas-cat,
who had been rudely awakened from a
matutinal slumber in the Lunt cellar and ignominiously
confined. At regular intervals he
uttered an appealing, protesting “Yow!” while
he glared through his bars.</p>

<p class='c016'>Next to him was Hen’s red “bantie,” also in
a soap-box, but more composed.</p>

<p class='c016'>Then came Don, for whom no cage procurable
was ample enough; so he was tied to a nail,
which afforded him liberty to fawn impartially
upon old and young, and occasionally to make
frantic endeavors to reach you in the dressing-room.</p>

<p class='c016'>Next to him was Snap, the Kemps’ black-and-tan,
miserable in close quarters; and at the
end of the row, quaking in abject terror over
the proximity of so many enemies, were Fat’s
precious white rats.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Is <i>that</i> all the m’nag’rie you kids got? Aw,
gee!” sneered the invidious boys among the
spectators.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It’s more’n <i>you</i> got, anyhow!” you and Hen
retorted from your covert.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Don’t you touch those rats!” commanded
Fat, with a jealous eye out for meddling fingers.
“They’re my rats.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It was very hard restraining the members of
the troupe in their quarters until time was ripe.
Fat, his face streaked in red and white water-colors,
and wearing a costume devised by his
mother from large-figured calico, was wild to
exhibit himself; and Snoopie, bursting with
prowess, demanded careful watching or he
would anticipate the program.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Stay in here, darn you! You’ve all got to
wait till the ringmaster says to come.”</p>

<div  class='figleft id011'>
<img src='images/i125.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Let go of me,
will you!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You sha’n’t go
out! ’Tain’t your
circus!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Who’s goin’
out!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Signs of revolt
manifested themselves.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why don’t you
begin?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gee, I’m hot!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“If you don’t begin
pretty soon I’m
goin’ home, and I’ll
take my rats, too!”</p>

<p class='c016'>So, urged from
behind, Ringmaster
Hen stalked forth and announced:</p>

<p class='c016'>“We’re ready to begin now.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He swaggered and magnificently cracked his
whip—a treasure consisting of a double length
of leather lash, cut by the shoemaker from a
square of oak calf, with a twine snapper and a
skilfully whittled stock.</p>

<p class='c016'>Fat Day, needing no second summons, immediately
bolted out. He gamboled and pranced
and grimaced and “wiggled” his ears, to the
applause of the amphitheater and the tremendous
excitement of the menagerie.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lem<i>me</i>! It’s my turn!” besought Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>“No, lem<i>me</i>!” implored Nixie.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You said <i>I</i> could go first, didn’t you, John?”
reminded Billy.</p>

<p class='c016'>Privately, you thought that the honor should
be yours; but you waived your rights as proprietor
and decreed:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes, let Billy go first, ’cause I promised.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Out went Billy and distinguished himself by
all the feats in his repertoire, after each one
saluting with the expansive gesture of the real
professional. Having exhausted the trapeze,
and having poised for a breathless instant on
his head, he finished by vaulting over three
saw-horses, in lieu of elephants, and plunging
into the dressing-room.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now <i>I</i>’m goin’,” asserted Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Naw; it’s my turn!” opposed Tom and
Nixie together.</p>

<p class='c016'>But Snoopie shoved between them and past
you, and was in the ring.</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie Mitchell—ragged, wandering, independent,
but at times despised Snoopie—was
as one inspired. Never before had he such a
circle of witnesses, and the wine went to his
brain.</p>

<p class='c016'>He flip-flopped frontward clear across the
loft from the dressing-room corner into Mrs.
Schmidt’s lap, and flip-flopped backward to the
dressing-room again; and bowed. He walked
about on his hands; and bowed. He stood on
his head (“That ain’t fair!” called Billy. “I
did that!”) longer than Billy did, and while in
that position spit, besides; and bowed. He did
the “splits” farther than you could, and kissed
his hand, while the spectators murmured various
acknowledgments of his posture.</p>

<p class='c016'>He rubbed his palms and lightly sprang to
the trapeze dangling from the beam.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>He</i> skinned the cat, but he skinned it twice,
and half into the third, and impishly hung poised,
while his shoulder-joints cracked and the
Schmidt hired girl moaned:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Howly saints!”</p>

<p class='c016'><i>He</i> hung by his toes and threw wide his
arms; but, suddenly letting go, with preconceived
adroitness fell on his back, amidst
muffled shrieks.</p>

<p class='c016'><i>He</i> chinned himself, but he did it ten times.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come in! That’s enough!” you ordered.</p>

<p class='c016'>He obeyed you not.
Instead, he hung by his
knees; he hung by one elbow
and swayed and kicked;
he straddled the bar and
went around it faster and
faster; and with feet between
hands, soles against it,
he went around that way, too.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i128.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>In the dressing-room
reigned despair and lamentation.</p>

<p class='c016'>“’Tain’t fair!” wailed
Tom, hotly. “I was goin’
to do some of those things
myself.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“So was I!” declared Nixie.</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie was now juggling balls while traversing
the official tight rope stretched between
two of the saw-horses.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Make him come in, Hen!” you called.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen snapped his whip at Snoopie’s bare legs,
and brought him to the boards.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Quit, will you!” snarled Snoopie. “Don’t
you go whippin’ <i>me</i>, or I’ll paste you!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You darned old fool!” you scolded.</p>

<p class='c016'>He wiggled his ears—wiggled them much
more than Fat could his—and twitched his
scalp, accommodatingly turning to right and
to left so that all might see.</p>

<p class='c016'>Then, breathless, crimson, perspiring, he
walked on his hands into the dressing-room.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What did you do all that for?” demanded
you, angrily.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Do what?” retorted Snoopie. “<i>I</i> didn’t do
nothin’! What’s the matter with you kids,
anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You did, too!” berated Nixie. “You showed
off an’ spoilt everything. <i>I</i> ain’t goin’ out.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Don’t you—an’ we won’t, either!” chorused
Tom and Billy.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, Jock! Fat’s got his rats and he’s takin’
’em away with him!” announced Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You come back, there, Fat! Darn you! bring
them back!” you cried, rushing to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c016'>Too late. Fat was stamping rebelliously
down the stairs. The disintegration of Schmidt
&amp; Walker’s United Shows, through jealousy,
had begun.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aren’t you fellows comin’ out?” queried Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Uh-uh! ’Tain’t any fun,” grunted Billy,
spokesman.</p>

<p class='c016'>“They say they won’t play any more,” you
reported to Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I guess that’s all, then,” stated Hen to the
spectators.</p>

<p class='c016'>With high hoots from the boys, and rustling
of dresses from the ladies, the amphitheater was
emptied.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>I</i> didn’t do nothin’,” insisted Snoopie,
grinning. “You needn’t go to blamin’ <i>me</i>!”</p>

<p class='c016'>But nobody answered him; and with a derisive,
“Ya-a-a! Your old show ain’t worth
shucks!” he scampered below, to join riotous,
admiring spirits elsewhere.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>“How was the circus?” asked father, politely,
at supper.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, Snoopie Mitchell spoilt it,” you accused.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What was the matter with Snoopie?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, he went and did everything ’fore the
rest had any chance—didn’t he, mama!” you
asserted.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Is that so?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Father glanced at mother, and they exchanged
a subtle smile.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What’s become of the receipts?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='c016'>You did not comprehend.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Papa means the pins you took in,” explained
mother.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, I dunno,” you responded, your chief interest
just now being in your dish of strawberries.</p>

      <div class='line'>Oh, the noble king of France,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>And he marched them down again.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c015'>FATHER and mother not only cherished
the idea that “it was good for boys to have
some work to do,” but they cherished it in a
distorted form. ’Twas not as though you were
opposed to work, per se. No, indeed; there
was a time for work and a time for play, and
any day you would have been very willing to
stay out of school and run errands or pile wood
or rake up. Then, work would have been (just
as your copy-book informed) a “privilege.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But witness: only Saturdays and after-school
and vacation would do for that, and the privilege
was changed into a hardship, with your father,
from his security, recollecting what he did
“when he was a boy,” and evidently taking it
out on you!</p>

<p class='c016'>For “when he was a boy” father “had to
work,” and rather vaingloriously (egotistically,
to say the least) presented himself as a living,
moving argument to apply to your case. However,
he was of little weight with you because,
privately, you bet with yourself that he never
had to work as hard as you—never! Other
fellows could skip off fishing, and everything,
while <i>you</i>’d got to pile wood or rake the yard.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Can I go fishin’ to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c016'>With a bluffness cloaking sundry misgivings
you laid the question before mother, hoping that
she would unwittingly answer yes, and that you
might entrap her into a family division. Alas,
mother was not to be entrapped.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ask your father,” she evaded, just as you
had feared that she might.</p>

<p class='c016'>So, reluctantly, you sought father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, John?” he prompted as you stood
before him.</p>

<p class='c016'>Sharpened to X-ray acuteness through strenuous
sire-ship, he interpreted perfectly what was
forthcoming.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Can I go fishin’ to-morrow?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But you have the yard to rake, you know,
don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I’ll rake it after school next week.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The promise tumbled eagerly out for inspection,
and father summarily condemned it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You promised that if I let you off last
Saturday you’d rake it <i>this</i> week—”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It rained,” you faltered.</p>

<p class='c016'>So it did. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
and Thursday you had carefully reconnoitered,
estimated, circled the prospect, so to speak;
given the yard every chance within your power
to rake itself, and thus add to nature phenomena;
and then, on Friday, when you had got
all ready, had come the rain, and balked your
farther efforts.</p>

<p class='c016'>Yes. You had done your best, and now was
it for you or yours to discourage Providence?
But father rashly plunged ahead.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I guess you’d better rake and have it done
with. Then you can go.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I promised Snoopie and Fat I’d go to-morrow.
Fishin’ will be dandy to-morrow. It’s
always best right after a rain.”</p>

<p class='c016'>You had begun to whine.</p>

<p class='c016'>“John!”</p>

<p class='c016'>When father said “John!” in that tone, and
with one exclamation-point, it indicated that
your cause was finally and flatly dismissed. An
additional exclamation-point might mean committal
for contempt. Accordingly, unwilling to
provoke this, after sniffling a moment, on the
safe side of his newspaper, and morosely kicking
the porch railing, you stalked off, slamming behind
you the inoffensive gate, and quite ripe
for any desperate deed that could readily be
undone, if necessary.</p>

<p class='c016'>The next day dawned splendidly. Never was
a better fishing day—never! Never would be
another so good—never! Yet father and
mother did not seem to care, and ate breakfast
as indifferently as though raking the yard was
fully as much fun for a boy as pulling out
bullheads!</p>

<p class='c016'>From in front somebody whistled persistently.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There’s Snoopie. He wants me to go,” you
reminded.</p>

<p class='c016'>Still remained time for a revision of the program,
if—if—</p>

<p class='c016'>“I hear him,” responded mother, mildly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Run out and tell him, so he won’t wait,”
suggested father.</p>

<p class='c016'>Enveloped in sorrow and shame you emerged
to the impatient Snoopie and broke the news.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I can’t go. My father says I’ve got to rake
the yard.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie stared in amaze. <i>He</i> never had any
yard to rake, for his father was dead, or something,
and his mother worked out by the day.
He never had to change his clothes, and he
could play hooky whenever he pleased. Sometimes
you almost envied Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, hang the old yard!” advised Snoopie,
incredulous. “Come on. She’s a daisy day.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I can’t,” you confessed miserably.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pooh! You bet <i>I</i>’m goin’, tho’, all the
samee! You’re missin’ it!”</p>

<p class='c016'>And on he passed, whistling, with ostentatious
blitheness, a disjointed tune, leaving you to
lean disconsolately over the fence and remark
him, and then to retire to face the flinty tyrants
within.</p>

<p class='c016'>You plumped into your breakfast chair, and
ruthlessly banged your plate with your knife,
and scowlingly bolted your food. But nobody
appeared to notice. After breakfast the routine
of the day was calmly taken up as usual.
Father went down town, to business; mother
bustled about household duties; Maggie the
girl sang as she removed the breakfast dishes.
It seemed to be accepted as a matter of course
that you should rake. For this was such a
morning made—raking. You raked.</p>

<p class='c016'>Higher rose the sun, and higher rose your
wrath. Happily scratched the poultry, and
viciously you scratched, with the rake. What
was your life, anyway, but one unremitting
round of coercion! Who cared whether you
had any fun? Nobody! Other boys could do
as they chose; but not you. No; not you.
You were always being made to do things that
you didn’t want to do. You were nothing but
a slave. And you would submit to it no
longer.</p>

<p class='c016'>The darned old fools! You would show
them! You would run away!</p>

<p class='c016'>Then—<i>then</i> (you hoped) would come upon
that household the time when, gathered together,
one member would say to another:</p>

<p class='c016'>“I wish that Johnny was here.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes,” would confess father; “if he were
only here he might go fishing whenever he
pleased. I would be kinder to him; the yard
could wait.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And I, too,” would quaver mother. “I understand,
now. I used to send him after a
yeast-cake, and never think how tired he must
be.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And I’d never mind again his being in the
kitchen,” would sob Maggie the girl. “No,
indeed. He should have all the cake and lumps
of brown sugar he wanted.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, Johnny, Johnny!” would wail all.
“Come back and try us once more. We’ll be
so different.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But they would plead too late. You would
be far away; perhaps at the very moment dying,
unknown, miserable, forlorn and forsaken;
dying in the gutter or by the roadside, of starvation
and exposure; and the people who found
you would inquire, among themselves, pityingly:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Who is he? Has he no friends?”</p>

<p class='c016'>And the answer would be:</p>

<p class='c016'>“None. He is only a poor little outcast,
driven by abuse from home.”</p>

<p class='c016'>That would be a grand way to die, if only the
household would know about it. Your eyes
grew wet, while your heart swelled triumphant,
as the picture took hold upon your sympathies.</p>

<p class='c016'>The aroma of fresh cookies floated through
the kitchen’s open door. You were aware that
Maggie would be expecting you. When warm
cookies were heralded, she had good reason to
expect you. You hesitated, and for some time
you held off, with the vague purpose of spiting
her or your mother. If only one or the other
would try to coax you in! But one or the other
didn’t. So, finally (the aroma proving beyond
human endurance) you tramped moodily in,
and from the fragrant pile abstracted a handful
of the luscious disks.</p>

<p class='c016'>Even as you did so you were proudly conscious
that another cooky day, and the pile
would await your coming, in vain. Very likely,
after you were gone, they would not bake
cookies any more. Or, if they did, the dough
would be all salty with tears. Maybe, as an
almost hopeless resort, mother would say:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Maggie, bake cookies to-day just as you
used to. Leave the door and windows open,
and perhaps—who knows—our Johnny may
be lingering about, and when he smells them
baking he will understand that we are waiting
and calling.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes, ma’am—who knows?” would reply
Maggie, chokingly.</p>

<p class='c016'>You also, choked. For even then you would
be dead, dead, dead. You could die in a week,
couldn’t you?</p>

<p class='c016'>You gulped down the last mouthful of warm
cooky, and suddenly as you raked you waxed
brighter. Why die? Why not live on, and
become famous? Would not that be far better
revenge? Some day, then, would reach household
ears word of a new star in the firmament of
glory; a name would be read, a name would be
spoken, a name resounding through the whole
world, name of intrepid explorer, dashing leader,
multi-millionaire, potentate over savage peoples,
what-not. And father would say to mother:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why—that’s our Johnny!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It certainly is!” would exclaim mother.</p>

<p class='c016'>And she would call Maggie, and all would
discuss the strange tidings. Soon the village
would be ringing with your exploits.</p>

<p class='c016'>The household would send messages to you,
of course, pleading for one sign of forgiveness;
for a visit, a token. But you would return with
scorn their missives, and ignore their entreaties.</p>

<p class='c016'>Or would it not be well to heap coals of fire
upon their heads? ’Twas a difficult matter to
decide.</p>

<p class='c016'>At any rate, you would run away. That very
afternoon should witness you steadfastly plodding
onward, face to the west, fortune and
revenge before, ungrateful, cruel home behind.
When tea was ready Maggie, and then mother,
would summon you in vain.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mother would say to father:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, I can’t find Johnny!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, he’ll come,” would assert father.</p>

<p class='c016'>But you wouldn’t. They would eat supper
without you; they would be alarmed; they would
inquire among the neighbors; they would search
up-stairs and down; nothing would give them a
hint—or would it be a more subtle rôle to
leave a note, a tear-stained note, with simply
“Good-by” writ within? That was another
point to be considered.</p>

<p class='c016'>However, the truth would dawn upon them.
At first they would refuse to believe it. They
would think:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, he’ll be back. You see if he isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c016'>You would <i>not</i> come back. Evening would
merge into night—but no Johnny. The night
would settle down; there would be weeping,
running to and fro, searching and calling, and
all the while you would be out in the dark and
the dew (and it got cold, too, in the middle of
the night) at the mercy of storm and prowling
beasts.</p>

<p class='c016'>When came the morn, it would find the household
red-eyed, distraught, and repentant—but
still no Johnny.</p>

<p class='c016'>Possibly the minister, in church, would refer
to you during his sermon; not mentioning outright
your name, because that would be too
direct and hard upon your folks, but nevertheless
by an allusion that should be unmistakable.
The congregation would know to what he was
referring, and all would turn and look at the
family pew—the pew of shame.</p>

<p class='c016'>Your desk at school would be empty. The
news of your departure would spread about.
Teacher would break down and cry when she
reached your name in the roll-call, and as a
mark of respect your seat would not be given to
another, ever. It would remain untenanted,
sacred, an object-lesson to parents. Maybe it
would be draped with crape, like the desk of
Harry Peters, who died. Say!</p>

<p class='c016'>Yes, you would run away.</p>

<p class='c016'>You were unusually quiet and subdued that
noon, at dinner. It was the quietness of resolve,
the subduedness of pity. Here was the
last meal that you ever should eat at this board—and
none save yourself knew it. Ah, what
a blow was about to fall upon the household.
What a secret was locked within your breast.</p>

<p class='c016'>It seemed almost a missed opportunity. If
the folks might only suspect, and try to make
advances. Then might you coolly rebuff them,
deliberately freeze them out, torture them with
shallow denials, and thus enjoy their suspicions
while denying them your confidence.</p>

<p class='c016'>But the meal progressed, and nobody acted
curious. That made you mad.</p>

<p class='c016'>“All raked, John?” asked father, kindly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c016'>You answered him as briefly as was possible
and safe.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That’s good. Do you think he has earned
a pair of white rabbits, mamma?”</p>

<p class='c016'>White rabbits!</p>

<p class='c016'>“He has been a very good boy, and worked
hard,” assured mother, smiling upon you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, we’ll see,” hinted father, also smiling.</p>

<p class='c016'>Gee! White rabbits were a serious menace to
your outworks. You perceived your defenses
giving way. Stand firm, John; stand firm.
You have resolved, you know; don’t be lured
by tardy bribes. What are white rabbits to
freedom, and revenge?</p>

<p class='c016'>No, you will not be a traitor to yourself.
Let the white rabbits come—but, like much
else, they will come too late. There will be no
John—no Johnny, no—no Johnny here to
give them to. And you smile in sickly fashion
and say nothing.</p>

<p class='c016'>You have the afternoon before you, and your
preparations to make. While, wilfully unconscious
of your sinister purpose, the household
again proceeds about its routine duties, you
make ready. You will not carry much with
you. Maybe you will take nothing at all.
Shall you leave your drawers and your treasures
untouched, and merely fade mysteriously from
local ken, or shall you select articles enough to
signify your decision?</p>

<p class='c016'>Oliver Optic’s boys, when escaping from the
authority of a harsh step-father or uncle, went
away with their possessions either slung over
their shoulder, tied in a bandanna handkerchief,
at the end of a stick, or else contained in
a trunk toted by aid of a wheelbarrow.</p>

<p class='c016'>With tears (tears well very easily) blurring
your eyes and occasionally dropping from the
end of your nose, in your little room you hastily
overhaul your belongings.</p>

<p class='c016'>Upon the bed (dear little bed!) you spread a
bandanna ’kerchief, and in it you place an
extra pair of stockings and your best necktie,
and—well, there doesn’t seem to be much else
worth taking, in the clothing line. A boy
doesn’t need much; one outfit can last a long
time. Besides, the raggeder you get, the better,
for the more pitiable will be your plight. Your
pockets already hold your jack-knife and your
jew’s-harp, and thereto you add your burning-glass,
and your cap-pistol (robbers and bears
might not tell it from a real pistol) and a
fish-line.</p>

<p class='c016'>Cast one farewell look about the little room
(dear little room!). It shall know you no more.
Does it hate to see you go? But it mutely implores
in vain. You settle your cap firmly upon
your head, and stifling a sob over the pathos of
it all you descend the stairs.</p>

<p class='c016'>You stick the bandanna packet underneath
your jacket. It would be nice if the household
might suspect it, and still not see it. But the delicate
medium is rather difficult to attain. Besides,
it is too late for them to try to stop you, now.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mother is in the sitting-room as you pass
through the hall, kitchenward.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Where are you going, Johnny boy?” she
hails, cheerily.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Nowhere,” you falter. “Just off.”</p>

<p class='c016'>You pause, irresolutely, a second. If only
you might be encouraged to go in to her, and
with strange meaning in your caress kiss her,
while she wondered at your tenderness; then in
after days she would recall, and feel all the worse.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, be sure and be home in time for
supper. We’re going to have hot biscuits and
honey!”</p>

<p class='c016'>What a callous way to let you depart!</p>

<p class='c016'>Noting, with minute care, each familiar
object—ah, those inanimate things; <i>they</i> know
and feel bad!—you proceed into the kitchen.
Here, right before Maggie’s eyes, you boldly
provision with two cookies and an apple. You
reck not whether she sees, or not; the die is
cast. You defiantly press on, straight out of
the house, and through the back gate.</p>

<p class='c016'>The deed is done. You have gone. You
are in the alley, and many a long year will
elapse before that back gate again swings to
your hand.</p>

<p class='c016'>You wish that the folks knew—but they don’t.
Your heart aches for yourself; your going is
so unheeded, the piteousness of it so wasted.</p>

<p class='c016'>You grow angry, and stiffen your neck. All
right; they need not care, if they don’t want to.
Perhaps they think you are fooling. You’ll
show them—yes, you’ll show them! Oh, if
they would only call after you, and beg you to
turn, so that you <i>might</i> show them. You’d
never even glance. The darned old fools!</p>

<p class='c016'>You stanchly round the alley corner, and
march away, down the street. Wild horses
cannot drag you back. You wish they’d try.</p>

<p class='c016'>Two whole blocks have you put behind you.
Your stern pace lags a bit. With the sky so
blue and the sun so bright and the maples
o’erhead so rustly and the sidewalk so flecked
with gold and the yards and houses along the
way so comfortable and friendly, really, it is
getting to be hard work keeping up steam. You
have to think of it constantly, or your fires die
down.</p>

<p class='c016'>The darned—the darned old fools!</p>

<p class='c016'>You have been longer in traversing this third
block. Another block, and the maples and the
sidewalk and the comfortable, friendly houses,
cease; the country begins. W-well, you’ll go
that far, anyhow.</p>

<p class='c016'>D-darn ’em!</p>

<p class='c016'>You have come to the end of the street; here
is your Rubicon. You feel that once started
upon that country road, with your handkerchief
slung over your shoulder, then it <i>will</i> be too
late! The idea rather awes you. It looks a
long way, into the world. And dying does not,
somehow, seem the attractive revenge that it
once did. You slacken—and halt.</p>

<p class='c016'>You take the bandanna packet from beneath
your jacket, and inspect it.</p>

<p class='c016'>Humph! Darn ’em, you meant it when you
started, just the samee.</p>

<p class='c016'>You uncertainly move forward again. If it
wasn’t for those white rabbits—. You walk
slower. You blink hard. You stop, as if run
down—which, in truth, you are. You blink,
and finger the cookies in your jacket pocket.</p>

<p class='c016'>Are the folks at home missing you? Supposing
that they find out you have run away,
and as a punishment deny you the white rabbits,
after all! The thought stings. You hesitate,
and sitting by the roadside eat the two cookies
and the apple.</p>

<p class='c016'>You are reminded that there are “biscuits
and honey” for supper.</p>

<p class='c016'>Perhaps—perhaps you have gone far enough.
Perhaps you’d better not do “it,” this time.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>When, rather sheepishly, you reënter that
back gate, you encounter no signs of confusion
and agitation. Although it seems to you that
you have been gone a long, long while, everything
appears serene and just as you had left it.
Nobody notices you.</p>

<p class='c016'>You slip up-stairs. The little room welcomes
you; you eye it diffidently, and challenge it to
ridicule you; but it only welcomes.</p>

<p class='c016'>You restore to their places burning-glass and
pistol and fish-line. You untie the bandanna
handkerchief, and return to their drawer the
stockings and the best tie. You fold up the
handkerchief itself, and put it away. You do
not need them; not yet. You have changed
your mind. But only they and you know what
a narrow squeak of it this peaceful house has
just had.</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c006'>GOIN’ FISHIN’</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c015'>IT was twenty feet long, and cost ten cents—a
whole week’s keeping-the-woodbox-filled
wages. To select it from amid its sheaf of
fellows towering high beside the shop entrance
summoned all your faculties and the faculties
of four critical comrades, assisted by the
proprietor himself.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That’s the best of the lot,” he encouraged,
not uninfluenced by a desire to be rid of you.</p>

<p class='c016'>So you planked down your money, and bore
off the prize; and a beautiful pole it was—longer
by three feet, as you demonstrated when
they were laid cheek by jowl, than that of your
crony Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>Forthwith you enthusiastically practised with
it in the back yard, to show its capabilities,
while the hired girl, impeded by its gyrations,
fretfully protested that you were “takin’ all
outdoors.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Your father viewed its numerous inches and
smiled.</p>

<p class='c016'>You clothed it with hook and line, an operation
seemingly simple, but calling for a succession
of fearful and wonderful knots, and a
delicate adapting of length to length.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thereafter it always was ready, requiring no
fitting of joint and joint, no adjustment of reel,
threading of eye, and attaching of snell. In
your happy-go-lucky ways you were exactly
suited the one to the other.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i156.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“AT LAST YOU WERE OFF”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>During its periods of well-earned rest it reposed
across the rafters under the peak of the
woodshed, the only place that would accommodate
it, although in the first fever gladly would
you have carried it to bed with you.</p>

<p class='c016'>Half the hot summer afternoon Hen and you
dug bait, for you and he were going fishing on
the morrow. Had you been obliged to rake
the yard as diligently as you delved for worms
you would have been on the verge (for the
hundredth time) of running away and making
the folks sorry; but there is such a wide gulf
betwixt raking a yard and digging bait that
even the blisters from the two performances are
totally distinct.</p>

<p class='c016'>With a prodigality that indicated at the least
a week’s trip, you plied your baking-powder
can—the cupboard was continually stripped
of baking-powder cans, in those days—with
long, fat angle worms and short, fat grubs; and
topping them with dirt to preserve their freshness,
you set them away till the morning.</p>

<p class='c016'>Then, with mutual promises to “be on time,”
Hen and you separated.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose,” said father, gravely, to mother,
across the table, at supper, “that I needn’t
order anything at Piper’s (Piper was the butcher)
for a few days.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why so?” asked mother, for the moment
puzzled.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We’ll have fish, you know.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sure enough!” agreed mother, enlightened,
and glancing at you. “Of course; Johnny’s
going fishing.”</p>

<p class='c016'>From your end of the table you looked keenly
at the one and at the other and pondered. If
the show of confidence in you was genuine, how
gratified and proud you felt! But was it?
Father went on soberly eating; mother, transparent
soul, smiled at you, as if in reparation,
and winked both eyes.</p>

<p class='c016'>You grinned confusedly, and bent again to
your plate. Yes, they were making fun of you.
But who cared! And you had mental revenge
in the thought that perhaps you’d <i>show</i> them.</p>

<p class='c016'>You turned in early, as demanded by the
strenuous day ahead. To turn you out no
alarm-clock was necessary. The sun himself
was just parting the pink hangings of the east,
and on earth apparently only the roosters and
robins were astir, when, with a hazy recollection
of having fished all night, you scrambled to the
floor and into your clothes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mother’s voice sounded gently outside the
door.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Johnny?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes; I’m up.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“All right. I was afraid you might oversleep.
Now be careful to-day, won’t you, dear?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Again you assured her. You heard her soft
steps going back down the stairs. She never
failed to make your rising her own, both to
undertake that you should not be disappointed
and to deliver a final loving caution.</p>

<p class='c016'>Your dressing, although accompanied by
sundry yawns, was accomplished quickly, your
attire for the day being by no means complicated.
Your face and hair received what Maggie, the
girl, would term “a lick and a promise,” and
kitchenward you sped.</p>

<p class='c016'>To delay to eat the crackers and milk that
had been provided was a waste of time; but you
had been instructed, and so you gobbled them
down. On the kitchen table was your lunch,
tied in shape convenient to stow about your
person. It was a constant fight on your part
with mother to make her keep your lunches at
the minimum. Had she her way, you would
have traveled with a large basket; and what
boy wanted to be bothered with baskets and
pails and things?</p>

<p class='c016'>Upon the back porch, where you had stationed
them in minute preparation, had been
awaiting you all night the can of bait and the
loyal pole. You seized them. Provisioned and
armed, you ran into the open and looked
expectantly for Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>From Hen’s house came no sign of life. You
whistled softly; no Hen. Your heart sank.
Once or twice before Hen had failed you.
Affairs at his house seemed to be not so systematized
as at yours.</p>

<p class='c016'>You whistled louder; no Hen. You called,
your voice echoing along the still somnolent
street.</p>

<p class='c016'>“All right,” suddenly responded Hen, sticking
his head out of his window.</p>

<p class='c016'>He was not even up!</p>

<p class='c016'>You were disgusted. One might as well not
go fishing as to start so late and have all the
other fellows there first; and you darned “it”
gloomily.</p>

<p class='c016'>After seemingly an age, but with his mouth
full and with other tokens of haste, Hen emerged
from the side door.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Bridget promised to call me and she forgot
to wake up,” he explained.</p>

<p class='c016'>Had Hen <i>your</i> mother, he would have been
better cared for. But, then, households differ.</p>

<p class='c016'>At last you were off, your jacket, necessary
as a portable depository, balanced with lunch,
and the can of worms snugly fitted into a pocket,
over the hard-boiled eggs; your mighty pole,
become through many pilgrimages a veteran,
sweeping the horizon; and your gallant old
straw, ragged of contour and prickly with broken
ends, courting, like some jaunty, out-at-the-elbow,
swash-buckler cavalier, every passing
breeze.</p>

<p class='c016'>As you and Hen hurried along, how you
chattered, the pair of you, with many a brag
and “I bet you” and bit of exciting hearsay!
How big you were with expectations!</p>

<p class='c016'>“By jinks! I pity the fish to-day!” bantered
“Uncle” Jerry Thorne, hoe in hand in his
garden patch, stiffly straightening to watch you
as you pattered by.</p>

<p class='c016'>You did not answer. Onward stretched your
way. Moments were precious. Who could tell
what might be happening ahead at the fishing-place?
Busier cackled the town hens, into view
rolled the town’s sun, from town chimneys here
and there idly floated breakfast smoke. The
town was entering upon another day, but you—ah,
you were destined afar and you must not stay.</p>

<p class='c016'>To transport your pole, at times inclined to
be unruly, with its line ever reaching out at
mischievous foliage and its hook ever leaving
butt or cork and angling for clothing, was an
engineering feat demanding no slight ingenuity.
The board walk, which later would be baking
hot, so that the tender soles of barefooted little
girls would curl and shrink and seek the grass,
was gratefully cool, blotched as it was with
dampness from the dripping trees. When the
walk ceased, the road lay moist and velvety, the
path was wet and cold, the fringing bushes
spattered you with diamonds, and the lush turf,
oozing between your toes, gave to your eager
tread.</p>

<p class='c016'>Rioted thrush and woodpecker and all their
feathered cousins; higher into the silver-blue
sky climbed the sun, donning anon his golden
robes of state; one last impatient halt, to extract
your hook from your coat collar, and now, your
happy legs plashed knee over with dew and
clinging dust, you had reached your goal.</p>

<p class='c016'>You and Hen were not the first of the day’s
fishermen. As the vista of bank and water
unfolded before your roving eyes you descried
a rival already engaged. By his torn and sagging
brim, by his well-worn shirt, by his scarred
and faded overalls, draggling about his ankles
and dependent upon one heroic strap, you recognized
a familiar. It was Snoopie—Snoopie
Mitchell, who always was fishing, because he
never had to ask anybody’s permission.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i163.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘JUS’ A BULLHEAD’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie’s flexible life appeared to you the
model one.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello, Snoop!” called you and Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello!” responded Snoopie, phlegmatically,
desisting a moment from watching his cork, as
he squatted over his pole.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Caught anything yet?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Jus’ come,” vouchsafed Snoopie. “They
ain’t bitin’ much. But yesterday—gee! you
ought to’ve been here yesterday!”</p>

<p class='c016'>No doubt; that usually was the way when
you had to stay at home.</p>

<p class='c016'>You tugged your bait from its tight lodgment;
you peeled off your coat and tossed it aside as
you would a scabbard; with feverish fingers,
lest Hen should beat you, hopeful that you
might even outdo Snoopie, you unwrapped your
gallant pole of its line, and selecting a plump
worm, slipped it, despite its protesting squirms,
adown the hook.</p>

<p class='c016'>The favorite stands at this resort were marked
by their colonies of tinware—bait-cans cast
away upon the grass and mud, some comparatively
bright and recent, many very rusty and
ancient, their unfragrant sighs horrifying the
summer zephyrs. You sought <i>your</i> stand and
threw in.</p>

<p class='c016'>From his stand Hen also threw in.</p>

<p class='c016'>An interval of suspense ensued. The placid
water was full of delightful possibilities. What
glided therein that <i>might</i> be caught! You besought
your bobber with a gaze almost hypnotic;
but the bobber floated motionless and obdurate.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Snoopie’s got a bite!”</p>

<p class='c016'>At the announcement you darted apprehensive
glances in Snoopie’s direction. You were
greedy enough to harbor the wish—but, ah!</p>

<p class='c016'>“Snoopie’s got one! Snoopie’s got one!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie’s pole had energetically reared upward
and backward, and, as if at its beckoning,
something small, black, and glistening had
popped straight out from the glassy surface
before and had flown high into the brush behind.</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie rushed after, and Hen and you discarded
everything and rushed, too.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Jus’ a bullhead!”</p>

<p class='c016'>So it was, and quite three inches long.</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie ostentatiously strung it on a bit of
cord and tethered it, at the water’s edge, to a
stake. Then he threw in again and promptly
caught another.</p>

<p class='c016'>Somehow, Snoopie invariably did this. He
was lucky in more respects than one.</p>

<p class='c016'>From each side Hen and you sidled toward
him and put your bobbers as near his as you
dared.</p>

<p class='c016'>“G’wan!” objected Snoopie, with shrill emphasis.
“What you kids comin’ here for? Go
find your own places. I got this first.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Presently, to your agony, Hen likewise jerked
out an astonished pout.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ain’t you had any bites yet?” he fired
triumphantly at you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“How deep you got your hook?” you replied.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen held his line so that you might see. To
miss no chances, you measured accurately with
a reed. Once more you adjusted your cork,
moving it up a fraction of an inch, and you
spat on your baited hook.</p>

<p class='c016'>Again you threw in, landing your now irresistible
lure the length of your pole and line
from the shore.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Quit your splashin’!” remonstrated Snoopie.
“I had a dandy bite, an’ you scared him away.
Darn you! can’t you throw in easy?”</p>

<p class='c016'>The ripples caused by your bobber widened
in concentric circles and died. You watched
and waited. A kingfisher dived from his post
upon a dead branch, and rising with a minnow
in his bill to show you how easy it was, dashed
away, laughing derisively.</p>

<p class='c016'>With a quick exclamation, Hen swished aloft
the tip of his pole.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Golly! but I had a big nibble! He took
the cork clear under!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c016'>You wondered fiercely why <i>you</i> couldn’t have
a nibble.</p>

<p class='c016'>As if in answer to your mute prayer, your
bobber quivered, spreading a series of little
rings. An electric thrill leaped through your
whole body, and your fingers tightened cautiously
around the well-warmed butt, which
they had been caressing in vain.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I’ve got a bite! I’ve got a bite!” you called
gleefully.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen and Snoopie turned their faces to witness
what might take place.</p>

<p class='c016'>Then your cork was stricken with intermittent
palsy, and then it staggered and swung as though
it had a drop too much. Your sporting blood
aflame, you bided the operations of the rash
meddler who was causing this commotion.</p>

<p class='c016'>The cork tilted alarmingly, so that the water
wetted it all over. With a jump and a burst of
pent-up energy (no cat after a mouse could be
quicker), you whipped the heavens with your
great pole; but only an empty hook followed
after.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Shucks!” you lamented.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, you jerked too soon!” criticised Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Darn him! he ate all my bait, anyhow!”
you declared. “See?”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>
<img src='images/i168.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘BITIN’ AGAIN’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>With utmost speed you fitted another worm
and very smoothly let down exactly in the same
spot.</p>

<p class='c016'>Scarcely had the cork settled when it resumed
its erratic movements. Its persecutor, whatsoever
he might be, was a persistent chap.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Bitin’ again?” inquired Snoopie, noting
your strained attitude.</p>

<p class='c016'>You nodded; the moment was too vital to
admit of conversation.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I got him! I got him! I—”</p>

<p class='c016'>You had exulted too soon. Out like a feather
you had whisked the meddlesome fellow, but
in mid-air, unable to maintain the sudden pace,
he parted company with the impaling steel.
Down he dropped, and while the lightened hook
went on without him he dived into the shallows
where mud meets water.</p>

<p class='c016'>You abandoned your pole; you plunged after
him. Upon hands and knees you wallowed and
grappled with him. With fish instinct, he was
wriggling for the deeps and safety. You grasped
him. He slid through your clutch. You grabbed
at him again and obtained a pinching hold on
his tail. He broke the hold and was off.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Get him!” shrieked Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Get him!” shrieked Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>Desperately you scooped up the slime. Once
more you had him. He stabbed you with his
needle-like spines, but you flinched not. You
hurled him inshore and tore after, not allowing
him an instant’s respite.</p>

<p class='c016'>There! He lay gasping upon the drier bank.
He had lost, and out of his one piggish eye not
plastered shut he signaled surrender.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of the two parties to the wrestle you were
much the muddier.</p>

<p class='c016'>“How big?” queried Hen, anxiously.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, ’bout as big as the first one Snoop
caught,” you replied, which was strictly the
truth.</p>

<p class='c016'>You devoted a few seconds to squeezing your
pricked thumb; then pleasantly aware that
several new arrivals were viewing your success,
you gingerly strung him and deposited him,
thus secured, in his native element. Here he
flopped a moment, but finding his efforts useless,
sulked out of sight.</p>

<p class='c016'>You baited up; you were more contented.</p>

<p class='c016'>Two pole-lengths from shore occurred a quick
splash and a swirl.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gee!” burst simultaneously from the three
of you; and you stared with wide eyes at the
spot where the bubbles were floating.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What was that?” ejaculated Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“A big bass, I bet you,” averred Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nobody—within your memory, at least—ever
had actually caught a “big bass” in these
haunts, but upon various occasions, such as the
present one, he had made himself known. To
doubt his existence was heresy. He was here;
of course he was. Nearly to see him was an
exploit accomplished by many; nearly to catch
him was accomplished by only a few less: but
really to haul him out had been accorded to none.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the meantime he cruised about, in his
mysterious way, and now and then made a
rumpus on the surface, to wring a tribute of
hungry “Gees!” from the astounded spectators
of his antics.</p>

<p class='c016'>You gripped closer your pole and barely
breathed. Perhaps he was heading in your
direction; perhaps, at last, he would accept
your worm, and, glory! <i>you</i> would be the boy
to carry him through town, and home! Could
anything be more deliriously grand?</p>

<p class='c016'>On the other hand, misery! perhaps he was
heading for Snoopie or Hen. However, he
might turn aside.</p>

<p class='c016'>Silence reigned; the atmosphere was tense
with expectation. Another swirl, a small one,
off a brush-pile nearer the shore, just to your
left. Cautiously you tiptoed down there and
craftily introduced your tempting hook.</p>

<p class='c016'>The cork vibrated. For an instant you lost
your breath. The cork dipped. You poised,
rigid but alert, daring to stir not even a toe.
The cork righted, dipped again, and slowly,
calmly sank into the pregnant depths.</p>

<p class='c016'>Furiously you struck. Your good pole bent
and swayed. You were wild with excitement.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Say! Look there! Look at John!” exclaimed
Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hang on to him! Don’t let him get away!”
bawled Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>Spurred by your down-curving pole and your
violent endeavors, they scampered madly to
your succor.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Don’t you give him slack!” instructed
Snoopie. “He’ll get loose!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Don’t bust the pole, either!” warned Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>As for you, you were fighting with all your
strength. The line was taut, sawing the water,
as valiantly you hoisted with the writhing tip.
Your antagonist yielded a few inches, only to
demand them back again. You were in deadly
fear lest the hook would not hold. You hoped
that he had swallowed it. But who might
tell?</p>

<p class='c016'>At any rate, you were determined that he
should not have a vestige more of line if you
could help it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Can you feel him?” asked Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Uh huh,” you panted affirmatively.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gim<i>me</i> the pole,” ordered Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>You shook your head. You wanted to do it
all yourself.</p>

<p class='c016'>Little by little, in response to the relentless
leverage that you exerted, your victim was being
dragged to the surface. Higher and higher was
elevated your pole, and the wet line followed.
The cork appeared and left the water. Victory
was almost yours, but you would not relax.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It’s nothin’ but a snag!” denounced Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>You would not believe. It was—if it was
not the big bass, it was something else wonderful.</p>

<p class='c016'>A second—and up through the heaving area
upon which were fixed your eyes broke a black
stem. Swifter it exposed itself, and suddenly
you had hoisted into the sunlight an ugly old
branch, soaked and dripping, wrenched by your
might from the peaceful bed where it long had
lain.</p>

<p class='c016'>Amid irritating jeers you swung it to shore.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, I <i>had</i> something all right—and it
was a bass, too; and he snagged my hook on
me. He took the bobber under in less’n no
time, I tell you!” you argued defensively.</p>

<p class='c016'>That was a favorite trick of the “big bass”
and other prodigies of these waters—to be
almost caught and to escape by cleverly snagging
the hook.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id006'>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“YOU LUXURIOUSLY DINED”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Hen and Snoopie returned to their stations.
You ruefully twisted your hook from the rotten
wood and tried in a new place for bullheads.</p>

<p class='c016'>You tired of this location and changed to
a log; and tiring of the log, you changed to a
rock; and tiring of the rock, you changed to a
jutting bank; and tiring of the bank, you waded
into the shallows, where, at least, the flies could
not torment your legs. In the course of your
wanderings your can toppled; you snatched at
it but it evaded you, gurgled, and gently sank
beneath. You borrowed bait from more or less
unwilling brethren, or appealed to the most
respectable of the riffraff cans scattered about.
From the zenith the sun glared down upon your
neck, and from the water the sun glared up
into your face, and neck and face waxed red and
redder; turtles poked their heads forth and inspected
you; and dragon-flies darted at your
bobber and settled upon it, giving you starts as
you thought for an instant that you had a bite.
You pricked your fingers on the “stingers” of
vengeful victims, and you cut your feet on tin
and shell and sharp root and branch; you luxuriously
dined on butter-soaked bread and salt-less
eggs (the salt being spilled), and you drank
of water which, in these scientific later days, we
know with horror to have been alive with deadly
bacilli; and Snoopie, lying on his back, with his
hat over his eyes, tied his line to his big toe and
went to sleep.</p>

<p class='c016'>Finally, spotted with mud and mosquito-bumps,
scarlet with burn and bristling with
experiences, in the sunset glow homeward you
trudged, over your shoulder your faithful pole,
and your hapless spoil, ever growing drier and
dustier and more wretched, dangling from your
hand.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mercy, John! What <i>do</i> you bring those
home for!” expostulated mother, from a safe
distance surveying your catch, none thereof
longer than a clothes-pin.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, to eat,” you explained.</p>

<p class='c016'>And she fried them for you, her very self.</p>

  <h2 id='ch08' class='c006'>IN SOCIETY</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c015'>YOU looked fine; simply fine! And well
you might, for had you not just gone
through with the ordeal of an extra bath—a
process which even when regular and weekly
nagged you almost beyond endurance, and now
as a superfluity certainly ought to bring recompense.
It seemed to you that if a boy went
swimming summers, during the season intervening
a good scrubbing as far as half-way down
his neck should answer all purposes.</p>

<p class='c016'>With your face shining like a red apple, with
your hair slickly brushed—by mother, and
your fresh waist neatly adjusted—by mother,
and your Sunday jacket and knickerbockers
faithfully brushed—by mother, and your
shoes blacked and harmoniously buttoned—by
mother again, there you stood between mother’s
knees while she coaxed into an expansive knot
your blue polka-dotted tie.</p>

<p class='c016'>Then she turned you about for inspection.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, well!” commented father, in acknowledgment
of your effect.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mother settled your hat delicately upon your
smooth crown.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Now, be a good boy,” she cautioned. “Be
polite, and don’t be rough in your play, and
remember to say good-night to Helen and her
mama, and don’t act greedy when the things
to eat are passed.”</p>

<p class='c016'>She kissed you, and father kissed you, and
escorted to the front door out you strutted.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Be a good boy!” called mother after
you.</p>

<p class='c016'>You decorously yodeled for Hen; Hen,
arrayed, like you, in purple and fine linen,
decorously made exit and joined you; and
decorously the two of you walked side by side
up the street, bound for the “Daner party.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Along the way, restrained by your feeling of
spick-and-spanness from customary gambolings,
you and Hen sought relief in a preliminary review
of the prospective menu.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I bet you we have ice cream—I seen Mr.
Daner orderin’ it!” avowed Hen, by his abundance
of enthusiasm atoning for his lack of
grammar.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gee! I hope it’s chocolate!” you exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Or strawberry an’ vaniller mixed!” supplemented
Hen, with a smack of anticipation.</p>

<p class='c016'>You “geed” again, and offered an unvoiced
prayer that, whatever the flavor or flavors, the
dishes be large.</p>

<p class='c016'>On ahead was disclosed the house of the
party. It was lighted from top to bottom, and
at the impressive sight your courage, buoyed in
vain by ice-cream, chocolate, or strawberry and
vanilla mixed, began to sink.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You go in first,” you suggested to Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Naw, sir! <i>You!</i>” objected Hen. “You
know ’em better’n I do.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“But I’ll keep right close behind. Honest,
I will,” you promised.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You wouldn’t, either. You’d run off and
leave me alone!” accused Hen, suspicious and
diffident.</p>

<p class='c016'>With the question of precedence still unsettled,
slowly and more slowly you and he approached.
Hanging to the palings of the fence, in front,
were the luckless (and invidious) uninvited;
among them Snoopie Mitchell, of course.
Snoopie never missed anything, if within his
reach, and he wore the same clothes wherever
he went, be it fishing or into the <i>crème de la
crème</i> of civilization.</p>

<p class='c016'>Your arrival was the signal for a shrill chorus
of jeering cries; why, nobody may know; yet
they caused you to flush with an unreasonable
sense of shame.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello, Jocko!” greeted Snoopie, affably
(Jocko, and not, as stated the family Bible,
John, being your actual name).</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello!” you responded feebly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello, Hen!” continued Snoop, determined
to be impartial.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello!” said Hen, also feebly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ain’t you goin’ in?” queried Snoop. “G’wan
in! What you ’fraid of?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“G’wan in yourself!” you retorted.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, I would if I was dressed up, you bet!”
asserted Snoopie—oblivious of the fact that
he was not expected.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Huh!” scoffed Hen. “You ain’t invited!
Ya-a-ah!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I know it; but I could have been if I’d
wanted to!” declared Snoopie, insinuating his
superiority. “I wouldn’t go to their old party!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Good reason why!” scoffed you and Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>This brief exchange of courtesies having been
accomplished, attended by mocking tongues and
glances you two proudly entered the gate, leaving
on the outside these your social inferiors,
and advancing up the walk, studiously elbow to
elbow, mounted the porch steps.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You ring!” insisted Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“No! You!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Whereupon, in the midst of the discussion
the listening door opened, and into the dazzling
interior you sidled together, and red as
peonies received your welcome.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>On the one side of the parlor were clustered
the girls, a close corporation in stiff little dresses
and stiff big sashes, and locks wonderfully
curled or tied with ribbons. They whispered
and giggled. On the opposite side were banded
the boys, in embarrassing Sunday clothes and
squeaky shoes. And they whispered and sniggered.</p>

<p class='c016'>Betwixt this side of the parlor and that
stretched a seemingly impassable chasm, which
must be bridged. Upon busy Mrs. Daner,
engineer-in-chief of the occasion, devolved the
task of establishing communication.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Clap-in and clap-out!” she heralded briskly.</p>

<p class='c016'>The little girls were hustled, still giggling,
into the adjoining room, and the folding doors
were drawn. You boys waited. Presently the
doors parted for a crack, and Mrs. Daner, as
official announcer, called, between them:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Harry Peters!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, Harry!” derided you all. Assisted by
obliging hands, Harry stumbled through the
crack, and the doors met behind him. You in
the outer room listened breathlessly. An instant—and
then came a tremendous burst of
clapping and laughter, and Harry, blushing and
flustrated, plunged back into your midst.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, Harry! Got clapped out! Aw, Harry!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I did it on purpose!” averred Harry, stoutly.
“I guess <i>I</i> knew. I don’t want any girl kissin’
<i>me</i>, you bet!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Henry Schmidt!” summoned Mrs. Daner.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen, being notoriously afraid of girls, must
have blindly plumped down into the very first
chair available, for scarcely had he entered ere
out he fled, headlong, in dire confusion, before
a volley of gay voices and staccato palms.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Johnny Walker!”</p>

<p class='c016'>That was you. You had been hoping, and
now you had arrived. Beset by the usual
ridicule—Harry and Hen the leaders in it—reluctantly,
after all, you left the safe society
of your fellows, and slipping through the fateful
crack uncertainly looked about you.</p>

<p class='c016'>The atmosphere was distinctly feminine.
Fourteen little girls stood each behind an empty
chair, in almost a circle, and eyed you roguishly.
Nobody spoke. You felt as graceful as a
hippopotamus and twice as large.</p>

<p class='c016'>Your wandering glance fell upon Mary
Webster. Mary nodded invitingly. And upon
Lucy Rogers. Lucy stared at you with intense
soberness.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hurry up, Johnny. Choose a chair,” urged
Mrs. Daner, she being, among her other
functions, the discourager of hesitancy.</p>

<p class='c016'>Poor soul, it devolved upon her to see that
the programme moved forward swiftly, so that
no one, from the belle and the beau to the fat
and the cross-eyed, should be slighted through
lack of time.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mary had nodded. It must be Mary who
had called for you; else why should she have
nodded? With confidence you darted at Mary’s
chair, and seated yourself.</p>

<p class='c016'>How they shrieked, and how they clapped;
none louder than Mary, and none more vengefully
than Lucy—Lucy, who, in truth, had
called you, and whom you had unwittingly
exasperated. Boys are so stupid!</p>

<p class='c016'>Another victim of female duplicity, out you
dived for the refuge of your own sex. You
resolved that sometime you would pay Mary
Webster back.</p>

<p class='c016'>Billy Lunt went in next. What befell Billy
was signalized by a sudden uproar of laughter
and soprano cries, but no clapping!</p>

<p class='c016'>Billy was being kissed!</p>

<p class='c016'>“A-a-aw, Billy!” and all of you pointed your
fingers at him, and prodded him in the ribs,
when, crimson and rumpled, he reappeared.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Who kissed you?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mary Webster; she tried to but she didn’t
do it square! I skinned out an’ they grabbed
holt of me, an’ I broke away!” boasted Billy.</p>

<p class='c016'>After clap-in and clap-out was instituted
post-office, and after post-office, drop-the-handkerchief,
and after drop-the-handkerchief ensued
King William, sung with whatever variations
local tongues had given to the old, old rhyme:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>King <i>Will</i>-yum was King <i>James’s</i> son,</div>
      <div class='line'>And he-e-e th’ royal <i>race</i> did run;</div>
      <div class='line'>Upo-o-on his breast he wore a sta-a-ar</div>
      <div class='line'>Which pe-e-eople called the <i>sign</i> of war.</div>
      <div class='line'>Now cho-o-ose the east, now cho-o-ose the west,</div>
      <div class='line'>And cho-o-ose the one that <i>you</i> love best;</div>
      <div class='line'>If <i>she’s</i> not here to <i>take</i> your part,</div>
      <div class='line'>Go cho-o-ose another with <i>all</i> your heart.</div>
      <div class='line'>Down <i>on</i> this carpet <i>you</i> must kneel,</div>
      <div class='line'>As su-u-ure’s th’ grass grows <i>in</i> the field—</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c020'>and then, as everybody knows, you are supposed
to “kiss your sweet,” and “rise up<i>on</i> your feet.”
Some couples kissed, but some wouldn’t.</p>
<p class='c016'>The gulf ’twixt the boy and the girl factions
has long since been effectually spanned. Mindful
of Mary’s meanness in befooling you into
accepting her inhospitable chair, you devote
yourself to Lucy. At first Lucy is lukewarm,
and with a pout of distaste only languidly pursues
you after you have deposited the handkerchief
behind her. You obey a command to “bow to
the wittiest, kneel to the prettiest, and kiss the
one you love the best,” but although this last
honor you would bestow upon Lucy, and struggle
desperately to salute her, she grants you
merely the tip of an ear.</p>

<p class='c016'>You persevere in your attentions, and by repeatedly
twitching her hair-ribbon into disorderly
streamers, you arouse her interest in you.
You chase her, screaming, up-stairs and down;
and in return she, with screaming unabated,
chases you down-stairs and up, and chastises
you with playful little slaps and pinches.</p>

<p class='c016'>Other couples are similarly engaged. Yet
you all are “good,” as goodness goes, among
your generation.</p>

<p class='c016'>Out of what is rapidly verging upon chaos, the
summons to refreshments brings organization
once more. The majority of the boys, comprising
the ruder spirits and the so-to-speak
unattached, gather in a corner, where it is each
for himself and pillage your neighbor. The
politer boys, which class includes yourself, stimulated
to their duty by Mrs. Daner, attend upon
the fair ladies.</p>

<p class='c016'>You watch protectingly over Lucy, gallantly
letting her have the largest piece of cake,
although you covet it yourself, and essaying
to practise other denials such as have
been impressed upon your memory by your
mother.</p>

<p class='c016'>You and Lucy converse. Your “Gee! ain’t
this bully!” and her ecstatic response, “My!
ain’t it, though!” establish between you a delightful
understanding. For her entertainment
you dexterously insert into your mouth a whole
cookie.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, Johnny! How awful!” she sniggers.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ice-cream is chocolate and vanilla, and
everybody takes both. Hen seems not to be
aggrieved by the absence of strawberry. Not
being a ladies’ man, he is in the corner with
kindred souls, but you can hear him.</p>

<p class='c016'>The dishes are large.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Piggie!” upbraids Lucy, when, having been
solicited, you accept a second. Nevertheless,
she does not refuse a spoonful from it, now and
then.</p>

<p class='c016'>Last come the candies, amidst which are
fascinating motto-wafers, always the source of
much mirth and amusement.</p>

<p class='c016'>All the company exchange mottoes. You
and Lucy limit your operations chiefly to one
another. For instance, you present her with a
pink motto, shaped like a four-leaf clover, which
says;</p>

<p class='c016'>“Are you fickle-minded?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You are too stout!” replies Lucy, with a
circular disk in cream color.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Forget me not,” you entreat—the words
being done in red upon a white diamond.</p>

<p class='c016'>“All in life is dear,” answers Lucy, rather
vaguely, with a greenish hexagon.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Are you in earnest?” you query—a pink
heart.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ask pa’s consent,” suggests Lucy, unmaidenly
as the encouragement may appear, with an
indented square.</p>

<p class='c016'>You have to trade around among various
friends before you can effectually respond. Sly
Mary Webster supplies you with “Say now!”
of which you immediately avail yourself.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Will you marry me?” asks Lucy, dared
thereto by companions, while those in the secret
whoop and shriek at her boldness.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Of course I will,” you assure her, providentially
possessing the very reply, on a yellow oval.</p>

<p class='c016'>“That’s what!” comments Lucy.</p>

<p class='c016'>The remark deserves better, but the best
that you can do is a “With all my heart,” on
a pink star.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>The festivities of the evening are over. It
is time to go home. Most of the mottoes have
eventually been eaten, and the rest of them
have been stuffed, along with other sweets, into
greedy pockets. Already some of the girls have
been called for by kinspeople, and some of the
boys have scrambled through the hall, and
noisily fled into the street. You encounter
Lucy at the foot of the stairs, and hastily thrust
into her hand a motto that you have been
saving—a fine shamrock in yellow, which says
for you:</p>

<p class='c016'>“May I see you home to-night?”</p>

<p class='c016'>There is a motto-wafer with a mitten on it;
has Lucy one, and will she be moved to give
it to you, as a mischievous rebuff? No; lacking
ready answer, she only giggles and attempts to
pass on.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But may I? I ain’t foolin’—truly I ain’t!”
you beseech, husky in the stress of the moment.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>I</i> don’t care,” calls back Lucy, half-way up
the flight.</p>

<p class='c016'>And so, much to the disgust of Hen, who had
counted upon your society going as well as
coming, you “saw her home” in the most exemplary
fashion—you keeping to one edge of the
walk, and she to the other, and between your
parallel routes space for a coach and four.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Edith Lucas is mad ’cause I said I’d go
home with <i>her</i>,” vouchsafes Lucy.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pooh! We don’t mind, do we?” you affirm,
employing a delightful plural.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Uh-uh,” agrees Lucy.</p>

<p class='c016'>Beatific silence thenceforth encompassed your
route until the Rogers front gate was reached.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Good-night!” piped Lucy, scampering for
the door.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Good-night!” cried you, running deliriously
down the street.</p>

<p class='c016'>And the next day all the boys in town pestered
you with their teasing: “Aw, John! went
home with a girl!” and you find “John Walker
is Lucy Roger’s beau,” chalked upon horse-blocks
and walks and gate-posts.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_65 c015'>ALL night those new and cherished
acquisitions, your copper
toed boots, had served
patient sentry-duty beside your
peaceful couch, now wistfully
to wonder why their lord and
master did not awaken and
see what had happened.</p>

<p class='c016'>The rising-bell summoned
you, but you only protested,
blind, and snuggled for another
snooze.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Snowing, John! Get up!”
called father.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Scrape, scrape,” came to
your ears the warning of an
early shovel.</p>

<p class='c016'>Your heart gave a wild hurrah, open popped
your eyes, to the floor you floundered, to the
window you staggered. Sure enough! The sill
was heaped to the lower panes, and in the air
the flakes were as thick as swarming bees.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ecstatically alive, you hustled on your clothes,
bestowed on face and hair a cold lick and a
hasty promise, and in the copper-toed boots
(eager for the fray) raced noisily down the stairs.</p>

<p class='c016'>You found the household less exhilarated and
enthusiastic than you had expected.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, this <i>is</i> a snowstorm!” commented
mother, in a blank way, pouring the coffee.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Um-m-m! You bet!” you mumbled.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It’s good for all day, I guess,” said father
solemnly, sipping from his cup as he gazed out.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, dear! Do you think so?” sighed
mother, aghast.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, gee! I hope so!” sighed you, fervently.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Shouldn’t wonder if we had a foot or more,
by night,” continued father.</p>

<p class='c016'>You heard him rapturously. Father knew—but
it seemed almost too good!</p>

<p class='c016'>Fourteen buckwheat cakes were all that you
could allow yourself, this morning. The snow
needed you; and grabbing cap and scarf and
mittens, with a battle-cry of defiance and joy
you rushed, by the back door, into the furious
vortex. The crackling stove, the cheery carpet,
the warm, balmy, comfortable atmosphere of
indoors appealed not to you.</p>

<p class='c016'>First, exultantly you dragged forth for a
preliminary canter your faithful sled, long since
extricated from summer quarters and held in
readiness for action. The snow proved satisfactory.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ain’t this dandy!” you shouted through the
driving flakes, across from chores in your back
yard to Hen at chores in his back yard.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i197.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“‘AIN’T THIS DANDY’”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“You bet you!” agreed Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>So it was, for boys; and Madam Nature,
hovering anxiously near, knew that her efforts
were appreciated.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Won’t the hill be bully, tho’!” you jubilated.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Golly!” reflected Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Got your runners polished yet?” he asked.
“Mine’s all rust.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“So are mine,” you replied.</p>

<p class='c016'>Down crowded the snow—there never are
such snows, nowadays; so jolly, so welcome, so
free from disagreeable features—and in school
and as you ploughed back and forth and shoveled
your paths, you and your comrades were
riotously happy.</p>

<p class='c016'>Down tumbled the snow—great, soft flakes
of it like shredded wool-pack—until, when it
ceased, as much had fallen as heart of boy
could wish for, which was considerable more
than would have satisfied the majority of other
people.</p>

<p class='c016'>The hill was covered, and “sliding” was to
be “dandy”—and that was your sole thought.
Why else had the snow come?</p>

<p class='c016'>To-day you remember that hill, don’t you?
Middleton’s Hill! Of course you do! The
best hill that ever existed. Perfect—for coasting.
Ideal—for coasting. Grand—for coasting.
Therefore an invaluable possession, although,
be it said, of importance rather underestimated
by the public generally.</p>

<p class='c016'>The hill started off gently; suddenly, with a
dip, increased its slope; and after a curve, and
a splendid bump over a culvert, merged with
the level roadway. Difficult enough to ascend
in muddy spring, in dusty summer, and even
in hard fall, when with the winter it came into
its own and was polished by two hundred runners,
horse and man usually sought another
route. It was practically surrendered to you
and yours, as your almost undisputed heritage.</p>

<p class='c016'>To be sure, occasionally some rebellious
citizen attempted to adapt it to his own selfish
ends by sprinkling ashes, in a spasmodic fashion,
athwart it; but a little snow or water soon
nullified the feeble essay. To be sure, occasionally
a stubborn driver, his discretion less
than his valor, tilted at the glistening, glassy
acclivity; and while his horses, zigzagging and
slipping, toiled upward, you and yours hailed
him as a special gift of Providence and gleefully
hitched on behind.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i200.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“HAILED HIM AS A SPECIAL PROVIDENCE”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>Yes, it was a paragon of a hill, with a record
of pleasure to which here and there a broken
bone (soon mended) lent but additional zest.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>The hill is ready. The track, at first traced
by the accommodating sleds and feet of a pioneer
few, gradually has been packed and polished
until now it lies smooth, straight-away,
inviting.</p>

<p class='c016'>The hill is ready. So are you. Your round
turban-like cap is pulled firmly upon your head
and over your ears, your red tippet (mother
knit it) twice encircles your neck, crosses your
breast, and is tied (by mother) behind in a
double knot, your red double mittens (mother
knit them and constantly darns them) are on
your hands, and your legs and feet are in your
stout copper-toed, red-topped boots. And your
cheeks (mother kissed them) are red, too.</p>

<p class='c016'>Twitched by its leading-rope, follows you,
like a loyal dog, your sled—a very fine sled,
than which none is finer.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Say, but she’s slick, ain’t she!” glories Hen,
as you and he hurriedly draw in sight of your
goal. From all quarters other boys, and girls
as well, are converging, with gay chatter, upon
this Mecca of winter sport. Far and wide has
gone forth the word that Middleton’s hill is
“bully.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ain’t she!” you reply enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c016'>With swoop and swerve and shrill cheer down
scud the sleds and bobs of the earlier arrivals,
and the spectacle spurs you to the crest.</p>

<p class='c016'>Panting, you reach it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You go first,” you say, to Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Naw; you,” says he.</p>

<p class='c016'>“All right. I’d just as lief,” you respond.</p>

<p class='c016'>Breast-high you raise your sled, its rope
securely gathered in your hands.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Clea-ear the track!” you shriek.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Clea-ear the track!” echoes down the hill,
from the mouths of solicitous friends.</p>

<p class='c016'>You give a little run, and down you slam,
sled and all, but you uppermost; a masterly
exposition of “belly-bust.” Over the crest you
dart. The slope is beneath you, and now you
are off, willy-nilly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Clea-ear the track!” again you shriek, with
your last gasp.</p>

<p class='c016'>You have begun to fall like a rocket, faster,
faster, ever faster, through the black-bordered
lane. The wind blinds your eyes, the wind
stops your breath, the wind sings in your ears,
like an oriflamme stream and strain your tippet-ends,
and the snow-crystals spin in your wake.
Dexterously applying your toes you steer more
by intuition than by sight. You dash around
the curve; you strike the culvert, and it flings
you into the air until daylight shows ’twixt you
and your steed; ka-thump! you have landed
again; and presently over the level you glide
with slowly decreasing speed until, the last
glossy inch covered, the uttermost mark possible,
this time, attained, you arise, with eyes
watery and face tingly, and stand aside to
watch Hen, who comes apace in your rear.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, that ain’t fair! You’re shovin’! That
don’t count!” you assert, as Hen, in order to
equal your mark, evinces an inclination to
propel with his hands, alligator fashion.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen sheepishly desists, and scrambles to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Cracky! That’s a reg’ler old belly-bumper,
ain’t it!” he exclaims joyously.</p>

<p class='c016'>He refers to the delicious culvert. You
assent. The culvert is a consummation of
bliss to which words even more expressive than
Hen’s may not do justice.</p>

<p class='c016'>Up the slope, in the procession along its edge,
you and he trudge; and down again, in the
procession along its middle, you fly. Over and
over and over you do it, and the snow fills
sleeve and neck and boot-leg.</p>

<p class='c016'>Occasionally, with much noise but little real
speed, adown the track comes a girl, or two
girls. The majority of them, however, use a
track of their own—a shorter, slower track,
off at one side. Poor things, condemned by
fate to their own company and that of the
smallest, timidest urchins, they pretend to have
exciting times.</p>

<p class='c016'>They sit up straight, girls do, the ethics of
society seeming to deny them the privilege of
“belly-buster,” and on high sleds—nothing
can be more ignominious than a “girl’s sled”—scraping
and screaming, showing glimpses
of red flannel petticoats as they prod with their
heels, acting much like frightened hens scuttling
through a yard they plough to their goal.</p>

<p class='c016'>For a girl to essay the big hill appears to be
“no end of” an undertaking. First she—or,
probably they, inasmuch as girls usually adventure
in pairs, to encourage each other; first
they, then, squat on their flimsy sled, girl fashion
(another reproach this: “girl fashion”),
and titter and shriek; and the one on behind
urges by “hitching” with her feet in the peculiar
girl way, and the one on before holds back
with her feet and says:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Wait!”</p>

<p class='c016'>They wait for bob and sled to precede, until
with frantic unanimity of action they seize upon
a favorable interim betwixt coasters, and with
trepidation are off.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i205.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“GIRL FASHION”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>But you overtake them.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Look out!” you yell, as on your bounding
courser you eat up the trail.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Look out!”</p>

<p class='c016'>You try to retard your speed by dragging
your copper toes. Anticipating the shock of
collision you lift the forward part of you, like a
worm reconnoitering.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Look ou-out!”</p>

<p class='c016'>One last agonizing appeal. And now the
pesky girls, glancing behind with sudden apprehension
in utmost haste and terror-stricken
confusion, amidst wild cries, by dint of laboring
feet veer ditchward, stop on the brink, and as
you shoot past rise flustrated and gaze after.</p>

<p class='c016'>Well, they have spoiled your slide. You had
a grand start, and goodness knows where you
might have gone to.  Darn it, why can’t girls
stay on their own track!</p>

<p class='c016'>Yes, indeed. Nevertheless, budding chivalry
grafted upon natural superiority prompts you
to take Somebody down on a real ride. You
would like this Somebody, if the other boys
would only let you; but most of the time you
cannot afford to.</p>

<p class='c016'>A sparkling little figure in white hood, fur-trimmed
jacket, white mittens strung about her
neck, and plaid skirt well wadded out over long
leggins, with her ridiculously high sled (girl-sled)
she stands by looking on.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Want to go down, once? I’ll take you,”
you offer bluffly.</p>

<p class='c016'>From amidst the giggling society of her sex
she bravely advances, and obediently seats
herself on your sled.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, Lucy! I’d be ’shamed! Sliding with
a boy! Oh, Lucy!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Lucy wriggles disdainfully.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Don’t you wish <i>you</i> could!” she retorts.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, John! Takin’ a girl! ’Fore I’d be
seen takin’ a girl!” joins in the gibing chorus
of your mates.</p>

<p class='c016'>You hurriedly shove off.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You got room enough?” asks your solicitous
passenger.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lots,” you affirm huskily; and crouched to
steer you leave the derisive crest behind you.</p>

<p class='c016'>Down you spin—you and Lucy, both gripping
hard the sled; your shoulder pressing
against her soft back, and her hair-ribbon
whipping across your mouth as you peer vigilantly
ahead.</p>

<p class='c016'>Here is the culvert.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hold on tight!” you warn.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Whisk—slam!”</p>

<p class='c016'>With a tiny scream from Lucy you have
landed, right side up, the three of you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Wasn’t that bully?” you query reassuringly.</p>

<p class='c016'>But Lucy must first recover her breath.</p>

<p class='c016'>This she does when finally, the sled having
entirely ceased motion, you and she must fain
disembark.</p>

<p class='c016'>“My!” she gasps. “I jus’ love to go fast
like that, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Her tone conveys volumes. Suffused with
proud gratification you pick up the rope.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You’re a splendid steerer, aren’t you!” she
says admiringly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Huh!” you scoff. “Steerin’’s easy.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Get on and I’ll haul you up,” you proffer.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Won’t I be too heavy?” she objects, delighted.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Naw,” you assert. “You’re nothin’.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Ignoring jeers and flings you carry out your
voluntary program, to the very end.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Thank you ever so much,” pipes Lucy,
nimbly running to rejoin her own kind.</p>

<p class='c016'>Shamefacedly you lift your sled, and with a
tremendous belly-buster are away again; and
when once more you reach the crest your straggle
from grace will have been forgotten.</p>

<p class='c016'>And at last, wet through and through, countenance
like a polished Spitzenburgh (you have
a right to the simile, as the barrel in the cellar
will testify), hands and feet like parboiled
lobsters, reluctant to withdraw but monstrously
hungry, you arrive at home to be fed.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>John!</i> Don’t come in here that way! Go
right into the kitchen and take off your boots.
Mercy!” expostulates mother, as in you stamp,
leaving a slushy trail and munching a doughnut
as a sop to that clamorous stomach.</p>

<p class='c016'>Wearily you return to the kitchen, and apply
your oozy, slippery boots to the bootjack. Then,
having abandoned your footgear, their once gay
tops now a sodden maroon and their copper toes
already showing effects of the friction whereby
they steered you down the hill, to steam behind
the kitchen stove, you obey orders to go upstairs
and change into the dry clothing that
mother has thoughtfully laid out.</p>

<p class='c016'>What a nuisance mothers are! Oh, dear,
won’t supper <i>ever</i> be ready!</p>

<p class='c016'>“Billy Lunt an’ Chub Thornbury’s got a
bob. Let’s us make one,” proposed Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let’s,” you agreed.</p>

<p class='c016'>So, combining equipments, you and he proceeded,
in emulation. The two sleds were
connected by a board seven feet long, bolted
as securely as possible to the rear sled, and
fastened to the front one by a single bolt which
acted as a pivot—and which, at a sudden jerk,
would pull out, and throw the major portion of
the bob upon its own resources.</p>

<p class='c016'>However, the bob was a very good bob, and
when cleverly shoved off and expertly steered
gallantly maintained itself against all comers;
even against Fat Day’s more aristocratic
“boughten” bob, which, with its gay paint
and varnish and rail “hand-holts,” was the
pride of Fat’s heart and the apple of his stingy
eye.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen steers (for steering is a science) and you
shove off (for shoving off is an art). Between
you two, pilot and captain of the craft, it
packed, on occasion, an inconceivable number
of passengers, with always room for one more.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gimme a ride. Lem<i>me</i> ride!” beseech
friends.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, you can’t! There ain’t any room!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“There is, too! I can get on, all right.”</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>

<div class='ic004'>
<p><span class='small'>“THE BOB WAS A VERY GOOD BOB”</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c016'>“G’wan! Don’t you let him, John! Don’t
you let him, Hen! We’re all squashed now!”</p>

<p class='c016'>This from the jealous load already booked.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Shove up, can’t you! Aw, shove up!
What’s the matter with you! There’s lots of
room!”</p>

<p class='c016'>And the pestiferous intruder squeezes in.
The bob looks like a gigantic caterpillar upside
down, so thick are the heads and shoulders in
a series of ridges. The board creaks. The
load also complains, grunting uneasily as each
boy, fitting like a bootjack into the boy before,
his legs stretched horizontally along either
flank, tries to “shove up closer.” Hen, his
feet braced against the stick nailed across the
points of the guiding sled, is the only unit of
the mass that enjoys any elbow-space. But
then, the pilot of a vessel is <i>ex officio</i> the favored
personage.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Darn it, lift up your feet, there!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Then somebody hold ’em! Grab my feet,
somebody!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Whose feet <i>I</i> got, anyway?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, quit your shovin’ so!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“G’wan an’ push off. We don’t want any
more.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gimme some room!” you plead. “I only
got about an inch!”</p>

<p class='c016'>They hitch along, and cede you another inch.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Clea-ear the track!”</p>

<p class='c016'>You bend and push. The bob starts. It
gathers way. One concluding effort, and you
land aboard just as it is outstripping you; and
kneeling upon your scant two inches, hanging
for dear life to the shoulders of the boy in
front of you, are embarked for your rapturous
yet excruciating flight.</p>

<p class='c016'>With lurch and leap, with whoop and cheer,
down zips the bob, every lad clutching his
neighbor as he may, each cemented to each—but
you, out in the cold, clutching most desperately
of all.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I’m fallin’ off!” you announce wildly.</p>

<p class='c016'>The two inches are only one and a half.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Jocko’s fallin’ off!”</p>

<p class='c016'>How delightful—for the others! The news
of your lingering predicament is received with
hoots of wicked glee.</p>

<p class='c016'>Around the curve, with everybody leaning,
and the rear sled slewing outward whilst you
balance on its extreme edge. Going—</p>

<p class='c016'>Over the culvert, a double jounce, and now
you are all but gone. Going, going—</p>

<p class='c016'>On the level, nearing the finish, speed slightly
abated; and now your tired fingers relax, you
cannot hang on any longer, your knees slip,
going, going—<i>gone</i>; but gone more gracefully
than you had reason to expect.</p>

<div  class='figcenter id007'>
<img src='images/i214.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“You didn’t gimme any room!” you accuse,
angrily, when you meet your squad as in rollicking
mood they tow the bob back toward the
crest.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>The old hill is not what it used to be. It has
been “graded.” No more do the sleds flash
adown as they once did. A new-fangled set of
city ordinances forbids. Hazardous curve and
inspiring “belly-bumper,” tippet and copper-toed
boots, clipper and bob, have vanished together,
leaving only a few demure little boys in
overcoats, and demure little girls in muffs and
boas, who sit up straight and properly descend,
at a proper pace, along the outskirts—and
think that they are having fun!</p>

</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c015'>THE sun was laying a fervid course higher
and higher athwart the bending blue; in
household kitchens was the odor of sassafras tea—and
in your mouth the taste of it; the air was
humid, the earth was mellow, winter flannels a
sticky burden, shoes burning shackles; snakes
had long been out, and turtles were emerging,
to bask, and to pop in, as of old, with exasperating
freedom; you yearned to follow them.</p>

<p class='c016'>The water <i>looked</i> warm. Snoopie Mitchell,
always authority on everything, bluffly asserted
that it <i>was</i> warm. But Snoopie appeared to
have a hide impervious to discomfort. Snoopie
did as he pleased, and nothing ever hurt him,
notwithstanding. Sometimes you wished that
your father and mother would observe, and
learn, to your profit.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Dare you to go in swimmin’!” volunteered
Billy Lunt, that hot spring noon, when it seemed
to you that you must burst out of your smothering
clothes as a snake out of his skin.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, we ain’t afraid; are we, Hen?” you
answered promptly, enrolling Hen for support.</p>

<p class='c016'>“No. We’ll go if you will,” retorted Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Snoop Mitchell—he’s been in an’ he says
it’s dandy,” informed Billy.</p>

<p class='c016'>Of course! That Snoopie! He was well
named.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw—I bet he ain’t, just the sam-ee,” you
faltered enviously.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He has, too. You ask him, now.”</p>

<p class='c016'>And Snoopie at the moment opportunely
sauntering near, Billy hailed him:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Snoopie! Ain’t you been in swimmin’
already?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie grandly nodded, and nonchalantly
spat betwixt two front upper teeth.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Course I have,” he answered. “Ain’t you
kids been in yet? Aw, gee!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Was it warm?” you inquired humbly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Jus’ right. Makes you feel fine. We go
in every day, about—me an’ Spunk Carey.”</p>

<p class='c016'>That settled it. The swimming season had
opened.</p>

<p class='c016'>During the afternoon at school you and Hen
and Billy were in an ecstatic tremor. From
behind his geography Billy darted into sight
two fingers, you responded, daringly, with two
fingers, and Hen telegraphed quick accord with
like two fingers—the mysterious “V” sign of
the Free Masonry of swimmers.</p>

<p class='c016'>Teacher saw, and frowned; but “teacher,”
by reason of her limitations of sex, could not
appreciate what you were having, and what she
was missing.</p>

<p class='c016'>With a proud consciousness, you and Hen
and Billy foregathered after school and started
creekward.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We’re goin’ swimmin’!” you called back to
former associates.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, it’s too cold!” they complained.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We don’t care. ‘Twont’ hurt us.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Bet you don’t go in!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Bet you a hundred dollars we do!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Bet you two hundred you don’t!”</p>

<p class='c016'>(Dollars meant so much less to you in those
days than in these.)</p>

<p class='c016'>“You come along and see!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Uh-uh. We’re goin’ to play ball.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Very well; let them stay and play ball, if they
liked. You would be entitled to strut on the
morrow.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the afternoon sun the creek lay smiling,
inviting, deluding. Upon its bank a new crop
of tin cans testified that the fishing season, also,
had opened. Some of the cans were yours.
The grass was soft, and sitting on it you vied
with Hen and Billy in pulling off shoes and
stockings.</p>

<p class='c016'>“First in!” challenged Billy, hastily peeling.</p>

<p class='c016'>You fumbled with the buttons which united
waist with knickerbockers, and silently resolved
that you would let him beat. Evidently Hen
was of mind identical. Billy, now naked like
some young faun, but singularly white and
spindly, gave a coltish little kick and prance,
and, with ostentatious gusto, advanced to the
water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c016'>Yourself exposed to the world, feeling oddly
bare and defenseless—a feeling which with
wont would disappear, as the summer wore on—you
stood and, shivering, wrapped yourself
in your arms and watched him.</p>

<p class='c016'>Billy stuck a toe into the water and quickly
drew it back.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Is it cold?” you queried.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Naw! Come on!” he urged.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let’s see you go in first.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“That ain’t fair. You come in, too!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Naw! You dared us. You got to do it
first,” declared Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Huh, I ain’t afraid,” asserted Billy.</p>

<p class='c016'>Resolutely he put one foot in. Involuntarily
he flinched—but he followed it with the other.
Witnessing his actions, reading that his toes
were curling, you and Hen jeered and whooped.
As you jeered, you continued to huddle, and to
shrink within yourself. Gee, but it was cold!
Somehow, the sun did not warm, and a little
breeze, heretofore unnoted, enveloped you with
an icy breath. You humped your shoulders,
and your teeth chattered. Hen’s teeth, also,
were chattering. You could hear them.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Go on! Duck over!” you told Billy, derisively.</p>

<p class='c016'>Billy was game. Suddenly, with water up to
his quaking knees, he ducked. In an instant
he was upright again—staggering, gasping,
sputtering, but triumphant.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come on in!” he implored, wildly solicitous
that you and Hen, hooting your glee, should
participate more actively. “’Tain’t cold.
What’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Followed by Hen you diffidently moved forward.
Shivering, gingerly you teetered down,
twigs and little stones hurting your yet tender
soles.</p>

<p class='c016'>Billy ducked again, apparently with the utmost
relish, and floundered and splashed, his
energy very marked.</p>

<p class='c016'>You experimented with a foot—and hastily
jerked it out.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gee!” you exclaimed. “I ain’t goin’ in!
It’s too cold.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I ain’t, neither,” decreed Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, ’tain’t cold a bit when you’ve wet over,”
assured Billy eagerly—but suspiciously blue.
“Take a dare—aw, I wouldn’t take a dare!
You’re stumped! Yah-ah! I’ve stumped you!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Diabolically did Billy flounder and gibe. He
paused, expectantly, for you planted a foot, and
gasped, and followed with the other; so did Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>Billy playfully splashed you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come on!” he cried. “Come on!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ouch! Quit that, will you?” you snarled,
as the poignant drops stung your thin skin.
“I’m comin’, ain’t I?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Deeper, a little deeper, you went, with your
piteously pleading flesh trying to recede from
that repellant glacial line creeping up, inch by
inch.</p>

<p class='c016'>Billy shrieked with joy. What is misery
when it has company!</p>

<p class='c016'>“Duck!” he cackled. “Duck! ’Twon’t be
cold after you’ve ducked.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Must you? Oh, must you? Yes. You
drew a long breath, shut your eyes, and desperately
butted under. So, you dimly were
conscious, did Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ugh! You choked; your stomach clove flat
against your backbone, and in you was not
space for air. Blindly you recovered, and
lurched and clawed and fought for breath,
while Billy rioted with wicked exultation.</p>

<p class='c016'>“’Tain’t c-c-cold, is it?” you gasped defiantly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“No; ’tain’t c-c-cold a bit,” chattered Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I told you ’twasn’t cold,” sniggered Billy.</p>

<p class='c016'>But you impetuously plashed for shore; so
did Hen; so did Billy. With numbed fingers
you made all haste to pull your clothes over the
goose-flesh of your weazened limbs and your
shuddering little body. You began to grow
warmer. You tried to control rattling teeth.</p>

<p class='c016'>“’Twasn’t cold!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Of course it wasn’t!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“We’ll tell all the kids it’s bully.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gee! I feel fine, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You bet!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let’s come again.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let’s come to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“N-no, I can’t come to-morrow,” you declared.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I can’t, either,” said Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>Retrospect was most delightful; but prospect—well,
here was a case where the prospect did
<i>not</i> please. Anyhow, you had not been stumped.
Your honor was intact—and you could rest on
your laurels. You could nicely combine discretion
with valor; so why not?</p>

<p class='c016'>“I’ve been in swimmin’,” you ventured, with
becoming modesty, at the supper-table that
evening.</p>

<p class='c016'>“John! When?” reproved mother, aghast</p>

<p class='c016'>“To-day, after school.”</p>

<p class='c016'>You endeavored to speak with the carelessness
befitting a seasoned nature such as yours—but
you awaited with some inward trepidation
family developments.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why!” ejaculated mother.</p>

<p class='c016'>You felt that she was gazing across at father.
Much depended, you realized, upon father.
However, he had been a boy, and he surely
would understand.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But wasn’t the water too cold?” she questioned
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Uh-uh,” you signified, steadily eating.</p>

<p class='c016'>“It <i>must</i> have been cold,” insisted mother.
“Why, the sun hasn’t had time to warm it yet.
I should think you’d have frozen to <i>death</i>!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“It was dandy. Makes you feel fine,” you
assured boldly. “Billy Lunt dared Hen and
me, and—”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I suppose if some other boy dared you to
jump off the top of the church steeple you’d do
it, then,” stated mother severely.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He’d have to do it first,” you explained with
a giggle.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, I <i>should</i> think you’d have frozen,”
murmured mother, with an appealing glance at
father.</p>

<p class='c016'>Perhaps <i>she</i> would have frozen—being, like
“teacher,” of a sex unfortunate. But not you—nay,
not mighty, dauntless, much-experienced
you, with your ten long years backing you up.
Huh!</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>Not always was swimming thus a task; the
embrace of the creek, deceitful and inhospitable.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ah, those glorious, piping, broiling summer
days, when from the faded sky the heat streamed
down, and from the simmering earth the heat
streamed up; when abroad, in the maples and
the elms and the apple-trees incessantly scraped
with ghoulish glee the locusts, and in the fields
the quail cried perseveringly, “Wet! More wet!
More wet!” when the sun ruled absolutely, and
everybody—save you and your fellows—stewed
and panted under his sway; “dog-days”—aye,
and, boy-days! Then, then, at the
swimming-hole the kingdom of boyhood held
high carnival.</p>

<p class='c016'>All nature lay lax and heaving, seeking shade
and avoiding exertion, as outward bound
through the stifling afternoon you and Hen
hastened for the swimming-hole. Even the
birds were subdued, and the drone of the
bumble-bee was languid, protesting; but what
did you and Hen care about such things as
temperature or humidity? Goodness! You
were “goin’ swimmin’!”</p>

<p class='c016'>As you pattered on, you and he, the boards
of the sidewalk scorched your bare soles, toughened
as they were, and even the baked earth of
the pathway along the vacant lots tortured, so
than with “ouches” and “gees” you hopped
for shaded spots or sought the turf. Beat down
upon your flapping straws the strenuous sun—his
beams, after all, not unfriendly, but merely
testing, and in a hearty way, welcoming.</p>

<p class='c016'>He recognized you two as akin to the meadowlarks
and the gophers, and he knew that he
might not harm you. You were immunes.</p>

<p class='c016'>The outskirts of the village are reached right
speedily; and now off at a tangent, athwart the
drowsy, palpitating pasture where the bees are
busy amidst the clover, making for a fringe of
trees leads a path worn by many a hurrying,
bare, and buoyant sole.</p>

<p class='c016'>You can hear, ahead of you, an enthusing
medley of gay shrieks and cries and laughter.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Crickety!” you say to Hen, quickening the
pace. “There’s a whole lot in already!”</p>

<p class='c016'>And you are not even undressed!</p>

<p class='c016'>On before, between the tree-trunks at your
destination, you can glimpse, strewn over the
sod or hanging from low branches, rejected
and dejected garments—limp shirts, hickory,
checked, tinted; stumpy trousers, dangling or
down-flung. You descry the patchy blue of
Snoopie Mitchell’s one-suspendered overalls; so
you know that Snoopie is there. You know
who else is there, too. The apparel is evidence.</p>

<p class='c016'>The sight redoubles your efforts. In rivalry
with Hen, panting, perspiring, eager, you penetrate
the trees and stop short on the bank.
You have arrived.</p>

<p class='c016'>Yes, here they are: Snoopie, and Billy Lunt,
and Fat Day (his body covered with hives), and
Skinny, and Chub, and Nixie Kemp (who can
exhibit the biggest vaccination mark of all of
you), and Tom Kemp (who is always peeling,
somewhere), and—oh, a glorious company,
wallowing like albino porpoises, threshing like
whales!</p>

<p class='c016'>“A-a-a-ah, lookee, lookee!” greets Snoopie
(indefatigable, omnipresent) shrilly, grinning up
at you; and for your benefit he stands on his
head and waves his brown legs above the
surface.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello, Fat!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello, Skinny!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello, Jocko!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello, Hen!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello, Nix!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come on in! Come on in!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gee! It’s dandy!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Water’s jus’ fine! Warm as milk.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You’re missin’ it! We been in all day.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Harrowing announcement!</p>

<p class='c016'>Nor you nor Hen needs invitation by word of
mouth. You are ripping feverishly at your
obstinate buttons, and tugging feverishly at
your pestering clinging garments. But how
absurdly simple was your attire, as reviewed
to-day from your environment of starch and
balbriggan, hosiery and collar. Nevertheless,
many a time, in your agony of haste, you envied
Snoopie, who with a single movement slipped
the one suspender of his overalls and ducked
out of his voluminous shirt, and with a whoop
was in!—happy Snoopie!</p>

<p class='c016'>Now, investing apparel cast aside in an ignominious
heap, at last free and untrammeled you
stride forward. From knee down and from
neck up you are dark-brown; between, you are
whitish-brown. Before the season closes you
will be an even brown all over (like Snoopie),
if your ambition is realized.</p>

<p class='c016'>First you must wet your head. This is the law;
else you may get cramps. You hurriedly wet it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Look out!” you warn with a significant step
or two backward, to gain momentum.</p>

<p class='c016'>You give a little run, and with a rapturous
shout and a grand splash <i>you</i> are in. So is
Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>Oh, bliss! The caressing, rollicking flood
envelops you to the shoulders. You wade, you
kick, you sputter, you blow, you plunge your
length, you squeal your joy intense—you convince
yourself and would convince others that
you swim; and your comrades wade, and kick,
and sputter, and blow, and plunge their lengths,
and squeal—and ostentatiously paddle. While
Snoopie, crawling about under water, grabs
legs; presently grabbing yours, and down you
go, beneath, to emerge strangling, clutching,
incensed.</p>

<p class='c016'>Stirred from the very bottom, all the pool is
beaten to foam, the sun looks down between
the spangling leaves and smiles, and the trees
fondly overhang, stretching down friendly
boughs.</p>

<hr class='c017' />

<p class='c016'>What a wonder you were, as a water performer!</p>

<p class='c016'>“See me float!” you yell—this being the
popular pitch of conversation.</p>

<p class='c016'>And you <i>could</i> float—almost, that is, until
your feet or your face sank too far and forced
you to rally.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, that ain’t floatin’! Jus’ watch me!”
decrees Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie really could float—and challenging
admiring eyes he proceeds to display.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Watch <i>me</i>!” implores Fat.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, gee! Watch Fat! Aw gee! That
ain’t floatin’! That ain’t floatin’, is it,
Snoop? Fat wiggles his hands down by his
sides!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Don’t either!” declares Fat, angrily, flopping
his mottled self to a standing position.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You do, too! Don’t he?”</p>

<p class='c016'>You could stand Snoopie’s superiority, but
not Fat’s.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, I didn’t wiggle ’em much, anyhow,”
grumbles Fat.</p>

<p class='c016'>With breath tight held and head tilted
stanchly back, launching yourself and paddling
furiously dog-fashion, you can easily imagine
that you are cleaving a path through the murky
flood.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You’re touchin’ bottom! Aw, you touched
bottom!” accuses Fat.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I wasn’t, either, darn you! I started ’way
up there at that stick and I come ’way down
here!” (The distance is at least a yard.)</p>

<p class='c016'>Betimes, splashing out, you all seek the banks,
amphibious-like; to streak yourselves fantastically
with mud, to cover yourselves luxuriously
with hot sand, to race, to gambol, or to loll
on the turf and emulously compare sunburn,
“peels,” and vaccination scars.</p>

<p class='c016'>In again you scamper, and the pool resumes
its cauldron turmoil.</p>

<p class='c016'>The sun, from his new station low in the west,
sends rays slanting in beneath the trees to signal
“Home.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come on, I’m goin’ out!” says Hen. “You’d
better, too. Your lips are blue as the dickens.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“So are yours,” you retort. “Ain’t they,
kids! Ain’t Hen’s lips bluer’n mine?”</p>

<p class='c016'>A farewell wallow, and out you wade reluctantly.
One by one out wade all. Your hands
are shriveled with long soaking. You are
water-logged. There is sand in your hair.
Languidly you dress.</p>

<p class='c016'>With Snoopie and Hen and Fat and Skinny
and the others—a company now chastened
and subdued—back you stroll across the pasture,
the setting sun in your face, the robins
piping their even-song, the locusts done and
quiescent, katydids tentatively tuning up as their
successors. The sky is golden in the west, pink
overhead, blue in the east. Upon the clover
the dew is collecting, annoying o’erzealous bees.
Skinny and Nix drop off to the left, Snoopie to
the right, each lining his straightest course for
home.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Good-night, kids!” they call back.</p>

<p class='c016'>Now in the village, the little group rapidly
dwindles. Presently only you and Hen and
Billy remain.</p>

<p class='c016'>Billy turns in.</p>

<p class='c016'>At his gate Hen stops.</p>

<p class='c016'>The next gate is yours. You are glad. You
are tired—so tired—so very limp and tired—and
so hungry!</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch11' class='c006'>THE SUNDAY-SCHOOL PICNIC</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c015'>’TWAS the day of the picnic—the Baptist
picnic. You yourself were not, by family
persuasion, a member of that denomination,
but the Schmidts, next door, were, and by the
grace of Hen, your crony, you were enabled to
gain admittance, upon occasion, into the Baptist
’bus.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ’bus was not scandalized. You had
been in it before, as Methodist, Congregationalist,
Unitarian—what not. So had Hen.
Only a few little girls were shocked, and gazed
at you disdainfully.</p>

<p class='c016'>“<i>You</i> ain’t a Baptist!” they accused.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Neither’s Blanche Davis!” you retorted,
carrying the debate into the enemy’s country.
“I guess I’ve got as much right here as she
has!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I came with Lucy Barrett,” informed
Blanche, primly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“An’ I come with Hen Schmidt. His father’s
a deacon, too!” you asserted.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, he ain’t—is he, Mr. Jones? He ain’t—is
he?” appealed the little girls, shrilly.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mr. Jones, beaming with long-suffering, Sunday-school-superintendent
good humor, obligingly
halted.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Henry Schmidt’s father ain’t a deacon, is
he?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes, I believe so,” affirmed Mr. Jones,
pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus you valiantly maintained your position—and
Hen’s.</p>

<p class='c016'>When you and Hen had pantingly arrived at
the rendezvous you had found yourselves in the
midst of baskets and bustle. The baskets gave
forth fascinating, mysterious clinks. In your
individual capacity of guest you had brought
no basket of your own, but you had helped Hen
carry down the Schmidt contribution, and you
knew of what it spake and smelled, and you
had peeked in under the cover. Besides, Hen
had told you, in detail.</p>

<p class='c016'>Clad in necessarily stout shoes, but quite
superfluously clean waists, you and he, with
the basket between, had hastened to the place
of assembly.</p>

<p class='c016'>Other boys appeared. Poor indeed was that
wight who could not rake up a Baptist friend—particularly
if his own church gave picnics.
Therefore, behold, as at the millennium, the
creeds of your world united to-day under one
flag—which happened to be the Baptist.</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie Mitchell, of course, was there.
Snoopie usually went fishing or skating on
Sunday; but at picnic-time and Christmas even
he did not deny the comforts of the church.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello!” you said.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hello!” said Snoopie nonchalantly. “Aw,
you kids are too late!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie never was too late. He had the
instincts of the ranging shark, and, moreover,
perfect freedom to obey them.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why?” demanded you and Hen breathlessly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“They took it away. Gee! Two freezers
bigger’n me!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“More’n the Methodists had?” you inquired
eagerly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You bet!” affirmed Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>You sighed—a happy, satisfied sigh.</p>

<p class='c016'>The passenger ’buses arrived, two of them.
They were greeted with a cheer, and scarcely
had the gaunt, rusty, white horses of the foremost
one swung about to back ere into it you
all scrambled.</p>

<p class='c016'>You and Hen promptly plumped down at
the end—end seats and the seat with the driver
being the choice ones.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Children! Children! Be careful!” appealed
the superintendent, mechanically. Poor
man, already he had done a hard day’s work!</p>

<p class='c016'>As well might he have cautioned a river
running down-hill. Jostled past you girls and
boys, elbows in ribs, shoulder thrusting shoulder,
in a competition that recognized no sex. Like
lightning the hack is occupied to overflowing;
packed with two lines, facing each other, of
flushed, excited children, with here and there
a flustered matron; you and Hen, as stated,
holding the end seats, Billy Lunt (he wasn’t a
Baptist, either) up with the driver, but Snoopie,
crafty, ragged Snoopie, hanging on at the steps!</p>

<p class='c016'>The ’bus rolls off. You all shout back derisively
at your outstripped associates.</p>

<p class='c016'>Father had darkly hinted that you should
take an umbrella and rubber boots, and spoken
of “total immersion,” whatever that might be;
but, lo, the sky is cloudless, the morn is of
sparkling summer, the air is fresh, everything
is lovely, the town is behind and the picnic
before, and you don’t care, any more than you
know, what he meant! You are in the ’bus;
and the only person you envy is Snoopie,
perilously clinging to its rear.</p>

<p class='c016'>With the horses at a trot he springs on and
off, drags his feet or sprints behind, and is continually
saying “Lookee!” while he performs
some new, adroit, impish deed. The women
gasp and exclaim “Oh!” “I wish he wouldn’t!”
and “Mrs. Miller, can’t <i>you</i> stop him!” Then
somebody’s hat blows off and creates a diversion.</p>

<p class='c016'>Half a block in your wake is the other ’bus,
and occasionally jogs apace a carriage, with
suggestive rattle of dishes and bulge of hamper.</p>

<p class='c016'>Your vehicle rumbles over a creek bridge and
slowly rounds a curve.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see it! I see it!” announces Billy, wriggling
on his elevation.</p>

<p class='c016'>You all stretch necks to “see it,” too. Yes,
there, just before, in the woods to the right, are
the forms of the earlier invaders—the good
men and women constituting the volunteer band
of provision-arrangers.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ’bus turns to the roadside. Issues from
the driver a long and relieved “Whoa-oa!”
But, even as he says it, you and the other boys
are out, over the sides. Under the fence you
scoot, to race, madly whooping, up the wooded
slope, fearful lest you are missing something.
After you scamper, more timidly, the little girls,
and last of all, ungallantly consigned to bring
the picnic odds and ends, toil your elders.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ’bus rolls back to town, carrying a man
or so delegated to get inevitably forgotten
articles.</p>

<p class='c016'>Now all the wood is riotous with scream and
shout. It is a wood filled with possibilities.
Early somebody discovers a garter-snake, and
at the rallying-cry destruction violently descends
upon the harmless thing. Immediately, dangling
from the end of a stick, it spreads confusion
wherever feminine humanity may be
encountered. At its approach the little girls
squeal and run, the larger girls shriek and expostulate,
and the various mothers shrink and
glare indignantly. The superintendent it is
who boldly interferes, takes the limp reptile,
and throws it away.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There!” sigh glad onlookers.</p>

<p class='c016'>But Snoopie marks its fall, and presently
recovers it; thereafter to carry it around in his
pocket, intent upon sticking it down unsuspecting
comrades’ backs.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the ravine is the shallow creek. As a
means of entertainment the creek is about as
good as the dead snake. ’Tis jump it and
rejump it; ’tis wade it with shoes on and ’tis
wade it with shoes off; and ’tis splash far and
wide, to see which boy shall get the wetter.</p>

<p class='c016'>Milder spirits may elect to search for “pretty
flowers,” or “help mamma,” or play “Pussy
Wants a Corner,” and “Ring Around a Rosie,”
where solicitous eyes might fondly oversee;
where busily labor and perspire the superintendent
and assistants, hanging swings and
hammocks, lifting, opening, and unpacking;
where benignly moves the minister, diffusing
unspoken blessings. But you and yours must
have more strenuous recreation. So already,
when word is transmitted that “they’re makin’
the lemonade,” your knickerbockers are torn
from shinning up trees, your waist is limp from
romping through the creek, and your face is
red, and scratched, and streaming, and dirty.</p>

<p class='c016'>You are having fun.</p>

<p class='c016'>Lemonade! Two tubs of it, in the middle
of each a lump of ice, about the ice floating
disks of lemon, and a thirsty crowd encircling
all.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Be careful, children. Let the little girls
drink first, boys. My, my! That’s not the
way!” cautioned Mr. Jones, as, the supply of
tin cups proving insufficient, some of you
evinced a disposition to “get in all over.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The little girls politely tripped off, wiping
their mouths with their best handkerchiefs.
You and Hen <i>et al.</i> lingered. Eventually the
tubs were left unguarded. The moment seemed
propitious for new diversion.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let’s see who can drink the most!” proposed
Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>The idea was brilliant. To hear was to
act.</p>

<p class='c016'>It was plunge in your cup and gulp; and
plunge it in and gulp; and fail not to throw the
residue in your neighbor’s face. Fast and
furious waxed the play, with Snoopie appearing
to be sure winner.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, you ain’t drinkin’ it all! That ain’t
fair!” you accused, and the other boys joined in.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Shut up! I am, too!” replied Snoopie,
angrily; and proceeded with his count: “Fourteen.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Distanced, his competitors paused, and jealously,
but half admiringly, watched.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Bo-oys! Bo-oys!”</p>

<p class='c016'>The gentle soprano voice with the reproachful,
shocked inflection made you drop tin cups,
the batch of you, and hastily look.</p>

<p class='c016'>’Twas the minister’s wife. In power she
stood above the superintendent, even, and only
slightly below the minister himself.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why, why! You mustn’t do that!” she
objected, bearing down.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mustn’t you? Well, all right; there was lots
else to do, and, soaked without and within,
reeking of lemonade, you withdrew to do it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gee—I drunk fifteen!” boasted Snoopie,
patting his stomach.</p>

<p class='c016'>He proved to be high man. Yourself had to
your score only the modest aggregate of ten.</p>

<p class='c016'>Behind, at the scene of the late contest, arose
sounds of lamentation and dismay over the
state of the tubs.</p>

<p class='c016'>Stately, mute, impenetrable, with baffling rag-carpet
covering their tops, in the shade stand
the two ice-cream freezers, and on all sides of
them the feet of you and your cronies, and of
the little girls as well, have well-nigh worn bare
the woodland sod. But now, torn away by
less exalted emotions, you and Hen revolve
around Mrs. Schmidt’s tablecloth spread on
the ground and weighted down with dishes.</p>

<p class='c016'>Here is to be your station at dinner. Other
cloths there are, spread about, but Hen recommends
his mother’s. There will be a family
feeling, and less chance of neglect.</p>

<p class='c016'>Drag slower and slower the minutes. Hen
goes foraging, and returns gleefully with a cooky
apiece. The delicious smell of sliced tongue
and ham and boiling coffee permeates the air.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Henry, if you and John don’t keep out from
under foot, I’ll take you right straight home!”
threatens Mrs. Schmidt, exasperated.</p>

<p class='c016'>Other women, too, lower at you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes, boys,” chimes in the superintendent;
“run away and play, and don’t bother the
people getting dinner. When we’re ready we’ll
call you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>But, oh, dear, supposing something should
be all eaten up before you got there!</p>

<p class='c016'>At last, at the very last—as the French
emphatically express it, <i>à la fin des fins</i>—your
rebuffs are over. You are actually bidden to
advance. ’Tis barely the wink of an eyelash,
but ’tis enough; and before a word is spoken
you are there, the two of you, sitting elbow to
elbow, on your calves, against the cloth: greedy-eyed,
watery-mouthed, faint-stomached.</p>

<p class='c016'>From right and left come trooping young and
old, none of them, save one or two couples from
the Bible-class, trooping from very far. They
settle like pigeons fluttering down to corn.
About each cloth a circle is formed. Nobody
is homeless. And isn’t it time to start in?
Alas! not yet.</p>

<p class='c016'>From his place (“Mr. Jones, <i>do</i> sit down!
You look tired to death. Sit right here!” has
been the imploration, and he has yielded) the
superintendent bobs up and loudly claps his
hands, and says: “Sh!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sh!” assist sundry whispers, as warning to
you and your mates.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is the blessing, for, as Mr. Jones subsides,
the minister rises.</p>

<p class='c016'>He prays long and fervently. Out of the
corners of your eyes you continue to scan sandwich,
and cake, and jelly, and pickles, while
your nose wriggles like the nose of an inquiring
rabbit. You wonder why the minister cannot
quit; but, ignoring every good stopping-point,
he proceeds on and on. You hear Hen groan
with pent-up disgust. You slyly groan back.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Amen.”</p>

<p class='c016'>It has come! Mrs. Schmidt’s glance flashes
rebuke in your direction, but neither you nor
Hen cares. High swells an instant chorus of
talk and rattling staccato of dishes. Hither and
thither flit busy servers; and, behind the backs
of the circle, down your way is progressing in
solemn state a huge tray of sandwiches.</p>

<p class='c016'>You watch it eagerly. It brushes your shoulder.
You and Hen grab together. They are
bun sandwiches, with cold boiled ham between.
Your mouth opens against yours, and your teeth
meet through it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yum, yum!” you mumble ecstatically to
Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yum, yum!” agrees Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>Come other sandwiches—tongue and beef
and potted ham; come cold fried chicken and
pressed veal loaf; come jelly—several kinds—and
pickles, sweet and sour. Sometimes you
hesitate.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I will if you will,” dares Hen; therefore you
generally do.</p>

<p class='c016'>Comes coffee, and more lemonade; comes pie—apple,
lemon, blueberry, custard; comes cake—chocolate,
lemon-layer, jelly-layer, plain,
frosted, cocoanut, spice, angel-food.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Um! Um!” revels Hen at intervals.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Um! Um!” you respond, in perfect sympathy.</p>

<p class='c016'>Comes ice cream in “heaping” saucers!</p>

<p class='c016'>Come cookies and sweet crackers, ginger-bread,
cream-puffs, kisses and oranges.</p>

<p class='c016'>You both have been obliged to kneel—expanding,
as it were, from your sitting posture.
And now the feast is done. Vainly you view
the débris; you have accomplished marvels, but
you can do no more. You sigh, and, sucking
an orange, reluctantly you stand. You waddle
off, feeling fat and stuffy, to convene with the
other boys, and compare notes.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, you ought to been at <i>our</i> table!” claims
Billy Lunt. “We had chocolate cake with
chocolate an inch thick—didn’t we, Buck?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Buck” promptly assents.</p>

<p class='c016'>“So’d we! So’d we!” retorts Hen. “An’
we had jelly-cake, an’—”</p>

<p class='c016'>“So’d we!” inform rivals, bound to uphold
the honors of their boards. “An’ lemon pie—”</p>

<p class='c016'>“An’ custard, an’—”</p>

<p class='c016'>“An’ pickled peaches—”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Golly! I’m ’bout busted!” chuckles Billy,
complacently.</p>

<p class='c016'>Standing companionably by, Snoopie harkens
and grins, but says little. Only from a bulging
pocket he extracts another orange and drills
into it. One may be certain that <i>he</i>, at least,
has missed nothing.</p>

<p class='c016'>Prudence might dictate a period of quiescence
as a tribute to digestion. But the day is short,
and a half a bun skimming into your midst—that
is, into the midst of the group, not into
your own midst, where it would have hard work
to find lodgment—arouses you to retaliation.
Back and forth and across fly the remnants
from the various tablecloths, and applause greets
every hit. Snoopie introduces a popular feature
by plastering against a tree-trunk a fragment
of a custard pie. Forthwith custard and lemon
pie are at a premium, these being the kinds that
stick. Then, interrupting the pleasant pastime,
charge upon your ranks horrified witnesses,
suddenly awakening to the crisis.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Boys! Stop it! Stop it at once! The idea!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Expostulating, they drive you all, shame-faced
but sniggering, from the premises. You
leave the plot looking as though a caisson laden
with cartridges of lunch had exploded there!</p>

<p class='c016'>The principal event of the day being over,
your elders relax into a state more or less
lethargic. The women sit and crochet and
chat. The minister goes to sleep with a handkerchief
on his face, and even some of your
juniors follow suit—members of the infant
class seeking the pillow of their mothers’ laps.
The Bible-class wanders off in couples. The
superintendent, only, is kept active by demands
of “Swing me, Mr. Jones; please swing me!”
from the little girls.</p>

<p class='c016'>Naturally the inspiration for you and yours
is to follow the Bible-class couples and spy upon
them; when they think themselves nicely secluded
and comfortably ensconced, to steal
upon them; and in the midst of their innocent
confidences to hoot upon them (with such delicate
insinuations as “Aw, Mr. Johnson’s Miss
Saxby’s beau!”—or “Say, Miss Lossing, Mr.
Pugsley wants to kiss you!”)—and then to flee,
riotously giggling.</p>

<p class='c016'>It is four o’clock. Prolonged shouts from
the throats of the superintendent and assistants
echo through the woods, calling together the
stragglers. The ’buses have arrived. Home-going
must be accomplished early, on account
of the “little ones.”</p>

<p class='c016'>All right. If the day is done, another day is
coming. You rush down, and you and Hen
again secure the end seats. The ’bus fills, its
load, on the whole, not so sprightly, nor so enthusiastic,
nor so clean as in the morning.</p>

<p class='c016'>Snoopie hangs on at the rear.</p>

<p class='c016'>The driver says “Gid-dap!” Somebody replies
with “Whoa!” “Whoa-oa!” supplement
a score of voices. To frantic encouragement
descends the hill, scurrying as if from Indians
or bears, a belated, last Bible-class couple.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gid-dap!” once more urges the driver.</p>

<p class='c016'>The ’bus moves. You yawn. Hen yawns.
You are tired and sticky. Hen, also, is tired
and sticky.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lookee!” bids Snoopie.</p>

<p class='c016'>He throws away his dead snake; his pockets
are empty again.</p>

<p class='c016'>Yet in the depth of the aftermath you
brighten. Your thoughts travel ahead. The
Presbyterians are to have <i>their</i> picnic next week!</p>

<p class='c016'>“You goin’?” asks Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“You bet!” you reply confidently.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch12' class='c006'>THE OLD MUZZLE-LOADER</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c015'>THE old muzzle-loader was so much the
taller that when you stood opposed to it,
only by a series of hitches, a few inches at a
time, could you extract the ramrod from the
slot. In your aiming exercises you leaned so
far backward that you formed almost a half
circle. The stock was scarred, the hammer
was loose, the barrel was rusted and the sight
awry, but it was a fine gun; yes, a fine gun, fit
for a boy to worship.</p>

<p class='c016'>And when, with father coaching you, its
barrel firmly supported in the crotch of the
apple tree and its butt pressed against your
throbbing chest, you shut your eyes and jerked
the trigger, as you picked yourself up while
invidious spectators gamboled and cheered, with
what gusto did you assert that “it didn’t hurt a
bit,” and avowed that you wanted to do it
again.</p>

<p class='c016'>How it happened that here you were, headed
for the open country with the old muzzle-loader
hoisted athwart your shoulder, probably no one
alive remembers, but you—and Hen Schmidt,
your aider and abettor as accessory after the
fact. Dangling against your right knee was the
powder flask, dangling against your left knee
was the shot flask, and the two banged and
rattled as you walked. In one trousers pocket
were wads, in the other caps.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lemme carry it?” pleaded Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>You refused.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Naw, sir!” you rebuked. “You don’t know
how.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Just to that big tree,” persisted Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>You relented; and under your watchful eye
Hen proudly bore the ennobling piece to the
tree adown the dusty roadside. Exactly at the
tree you claimed possession again.</p>

<p class='c016'>To-day, looking back, can you not see yourself,
a sturdy little figure trudging valorously
onward, with the two flasks swaying and jiggling
and the old gun cutting like sin into your
uncomplaining flesh, and with heart so buoyed
by the glorious present that it refused to think
on the dubious future; and Hen, scarcely less
elate, solicitous to relieve you of your burden,
keeping pace, step for step?</p>

<p class='c016'>The birds, flitting over or hopping upon
either hand along your route, witnessed and
gaily laughed. Well might they laugh, because
with impunity. Your death-dealing weapon
was not loaded; not yet. But presently you
halt and in an angle of the rail fence you load,
do the two of you, yourself operating, while
Hen, keenly critical, at each movement declaims
and suggests.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, gee! That ain’t enough powder!”
scoffs Hen. “What you ’fraid of? If it was
mine, you bet I’d put in twice as much!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“I guess I know,” you retort. “Guess I’ve
seen my father load more times ’n you ever
have! What you want to do, bust it?”</p>

<p class='c016'>The powder is dumped into the muzzle, the
gun being propped slantwise so that you may
work conveniently. The invincible grains fall
in a tinkling shower through the black cylinder.
You stuff in a wad.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Here—” says Hen. “Lemme do it.”</p>

<p class='c016'>You ram it down, and Hen rams it down.
In goes the shot, No. 4, nice and large. You
insert the final wad. You ram, and Hen rams.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Look out!” you warn Hen, who edges so
close as to joggle you; and with breathless care
you press upon the nipple a cap, the way you
have seen your father do, and you lower the
protecting hammer over it, also the way you
have seen your father do. Assisted by Hen
you restore the ramrod to its groove. You
straighten up. You are ready. You shoulder
arms.</p>

<p class='c016'>You and Hen climb the fence and scale the
hill, upon whose slope begins your favorite
patch of timber. Making sport of your backs,
along the fence that you have just quitted
scampers a chipmunk, but you do not know.
Your thoughts are ahead.</p>

<p class='c016'>The consciousness that your gun is charged
imbues you with a strange thrill of importance.
You are deadly. Come what may, lion, bear,
wildcat, squirrel, rabbit, eagle, owl, partridge,
you are prepared, so let them one and all beware.</p>

<p class='c016'>You and Hen talk in guarded tones, whilst
your four eyes rove hither and thither, greedy
to sight prey. But under-foot, stealthy though
you fancy your advance, rustle the dried leaves,
spreading afar the news of your passage; and
hushed though you consider your voices, they
penetrate into sharp ears attuned to catch the
slightest alien sound. Eyes, sharper than yours,
widen and wait.</p>

<p class='c016'>You would give the world to see a rabbit or a
squirrel. You have just as much chance of
seeing a rabbit or a squirrel as you have of seeing
a hippopotamus. However, it doesn’t matter.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hist! On before something twitters.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There’s a bird!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sh, can’t you! I hear him!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Cautiously you and Hen steal forward, tip-toeing
over crackling leaf and twig, your gaze
riveted on the distance.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see him!” announces Hen, excitedly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Where?” you whisper.</p>

<p class='c016'>“There—in that tree! Now he’s runnin’
’round the trunk! He’s a woodpecker.” (Naturalists
might cavil and term him a “warbler,”
but just the same he acts like a woodpecker!)
“Can’t you see him?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Alas, you can’t—at least, you don’t. Hen
cannot abide such stupidity. Besides, the thing
is liable to make off.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ain’t you got any eyes? Gee whizz!
Gimme the gun. I can pop him from here.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Give Hen the gun? Well, hardly! You
clutch it the tighter, and strain and peer. Now
you glimpse him—a tiny chap in a pepper-and-salt
suit, busily engaged in pecking at the bark
beneath his toes.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I see him!” you mutter exultantly.</p>

<p class='c016'>You stoop; Hen stoops. You glide up, making
service of covert afforded by tree and bush,
and your flasks catch, and sometimes you step
on them. Hen, too, glides, just behind, imitating
your every movement.</p>

<p class='c016'>The hour is portentous, but the dare-devil
bird braves it and maintains his post at table.
Possibly, deceived by your woodcraft (as you
fondly suppose), he is oblivious to the fact that
yard by yard two boys are drawing closer and
closer. You are breathing hard, and to your rear
pants Hen, for the advance has been onerous.</p>

<p class='c016'>“G’wan and shoot! He’ll fly away,” urges
Hen, hoarsely.</p>

<p class='c016'>Yes, you are near enough. No. 4 shot at
fifteen yards ought to do the business for that
chap. You slowly settle upon your knees, behind
the tree trunk which is your shelter, and
cock your piece. At the click the “woodpecker”
for an instant ceases operations, and
flirts his tail inquisitively.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Darn it—you’ve scared him!” you accuse
Hen, who shifts and squirms at your back, in
attempts to secure a better view. Hen holds
himself in suspense, apparently well-nigh suffocating
with the effort. You bring your piece to
bear, but it is so long and awkward that you
are being worsted in the struggle, when Hen
eagerly proposes:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Lay it on my shoulder!”</p>

<p class='c016'>You recede a little, and Hen wriggles forward,
the transfer being accomplished with mingled
fear and haste.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen’s shoulder is rather low for an ideal rest,
but you may not complain. You sink as far
as possible, and aim. The muzzle projects
beyond the tree trunk, and wavers in space.
Beyond the space is your suspicious woodpecker,
a creature of the most unexpected and eccentric
movements imaginable. He never stays “put.”
Just as the sight approaches him, he changes
position; and just as he approaches the sight, it
changes. A conjunction of the two seems
hopeless.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Why don’t you shoot? What’s the matter
with you?” gasps Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>You shut both eyes. Boom!</p>

<p class='c016'>Backward you keel, head down, heels up,
and the gun, jumping from Hen’s shoulder,
rasps along the tree to the ground.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Did I hit him? Where’d he go?” you cry
frantically, staggering to your feet.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen is bounding toward the tree whereon
the impudent bird had been foraging. You
wonder that the tree yet remains, but there it is,
to all appearances as hale as ever.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Did I hit him?” you repeat, seizing the
gun and following.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I dunno. But he flew off kind of funny,”
reports Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Find any blood? I bet I wounded him like
everything, anyhow!” you assert. The woodpecker
must have bled internally, for, search
as you two might, no tell-tale splashes of gore
could be discovered. There were even no
feathers. You scanned the tree, but upon close
inspection it still persisted in acknowledging no
damage, despite the frightful leaden deluge to
which you had subjected it.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, you missed him! Aw, gee!” suddenly
bemoans Hen, overcome by disappointment.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Didn’t neither. He flew just when I shot,
and I couldn’t stop!” you reply, defensively—unmindful
of the discrepancy evident between
your denial and your excuse.</p>

<p class='c016'>“If you’d let me shoot I’d have got him,”
declares Hen, unplacated.</p>

<p class='c016'>You proceed to load. Hen moodily holds
aloof from helping you ram, and you regain in
some measure your lost caste only when you
offer him the privilege of the ammunition
flasks. These he dons, and by this little touch
of diplomacy you smooth over his ill humor.</p>

<p class='c016'>Together you and he scout along the crispy
ridge, ever on the qui vive for another mark,
beast or bird. Crows scold. Ah, if you could
but bag a crow! But they always flap off too
soon. Bluejays jeer. You would stop that
mighty quick if they would give you a chance.
But they don’t. Even woodpeckers fight shy
of that inimical, albeit not unerring, gun.</p>

<p class='c016'>The gun aforesaid is now growing so heavy
that the fact cannot be ignored. You balance
it on one portion of your anatomy, and on
another; yet the more it weighs and the sharper
wax its angles, and you can secure no lasting
ease.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I’ll carry it,” volunteers Hen, prompt to
take advantage of your significant maneuvers.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Uh-uh,” you decline stanchly. You compromise
by suggesting, in a moment, with off-hand
bluffness: “Say, let’s sit down a while.
There’s nothin’ up here to shoot.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Naw,” responds Hen, “I’ll tell you—let’s
shoot woodchucks!”</p>

<p class='c016'>The idea appeals. After “shooting” woodpeckers,
“shooting” woodchucks ought to prove
a pleasing diversion.</p>

<p class='c016'>With the gun as angular as ever, but with
your hunting instincts piqued anew, you followed
while Hen led to the nearest woodchuck
hole: that burrow under the stump on the side
of the hill, across from Squire Lucas’s pasture;
a matchless lair for an old ’chuck such as was
the occupant, whence he could sally forth and
wallow in the squire’s clover to his heart’s and
stomach’s content.</p>

<p class='c016'>Many a covetous glance had the boys of
town and country cast toward this burrow;
many a fruitless attack had silly dogs made
upon its unresponsive portals; from time to time
fresh earth about the entrance popularly indicated
that the ’chuck was enlarging and remodeling
his apartments, and it was commonly
believed that he had tunneled clear through the
hill: laughing to scorn the foes that vainly compassed
him about, he lived and fattened, and
spoiled as much clover as he could.</p>

<p class='c016'>With bated breath and gingerly tread, you
and Hen sneaked to ambush under cover of the
zigzag rail fence that diagonally skirted the foot
of the hill, before the woodchuck’s dwelling.
Ah, how many other boys had lurked there, for
hope springs eternal.</p>

<p class='c016'>You trained your grim weapon upon the
region of the hole. You allowed Hen to have
a squint adown the trusty, and rusty, barrel.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Gee! I bet that’ll pepper him!” commended
Hen; and laying aside his flasks he
equipped himself with a rock in each hand, for
aiding in the proposed job.</p>

<p class='c016'>Very peaceful and cozy was it there, against
the fence, with Indian Summer (in retrospect,
those falls were all Indian Summer) around
you, the warm sun shining upon you, and
the warm grass and pungent weeds an elastic
cushion underneath. It was an agreeable
change, to surrender your gun to the fence, and
relax.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sh!” whispered Hen, angrily, when you
sought to straighten a leg.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I don’t believe he’s comin’ out,” you whispered
back.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes, he will,” averred Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Maybe he doesn’t stay there any more,”
you hazarded anxiously.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Course he does!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Maybe he’s gone to sleep for the winter,
though.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sh! Shut up! He won’t come out as long
as you’re talkin’!”</p>

<p class='c016'>You subsided, and with cheekbone glued to
the gunstock, and eyes ferociously glaring along
the barrel, at the hole beyond, you expectantly
bided the first rash movement on the part of
Mr. ’Chuck.</p>

<p class='c016'>In the meantime, what of that woodchuck?
Lured afield by the pleasant weather, from his
predatory tour he was leisurely returning—halting
now to nuzzle amidst the stubble, now
to scratch—for a mid-day nap within his subterrene
retreat. He waddled into a dried ditch
and out again, slipped through his private
wicket in a boundary hedge, and gradually
working up the slope was approaching his
home, on the side opposite to your rail fence,
when Hen, suddenly espying him, was astounded
into the yelp: “There he is! Shoot!
Shoot!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Startled into immobility, the woodchuck
stared about with quivering whiskers and
bulging eyes. Boys!</p>

<p class='c016'>As in a dream, you vaguely saw a squat,
furry shape, a cleft, vibrant nose and two broad,
yellow teeth; and with the remembrance that
your gun was pointing in the general direction
of this combination, you desperately tugged at
the trigger. Your sole thought was to “shoot,
shoot,” the quicker the better. The report
was the thing.</p>

<p class='c016'>But no report came. The trigger would not
budge.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Darn it! You old fool, you! You ain’t got it
cocked!” shrieked Hen, grabbing at your weapon.</p>

<p class='c016'>With a whistle of decision the woodchuck
bolted for sanctuary. He clawed, he slid, he
sprawled, all at once. Hen frenziedly delivered
both rocks. The ’chuck, at the mouth of his
burrow, in a second more would have swung on
the pivot of his four short, stout little legs and
have whisked in like a brindled streak, when,
having succeeded in cocking your piece, you
blindly let go—bang!</p>

<p class='c016'>The butt slammed you under the chin, knocking
your teeth together upon your lower lip.
You noted it not.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We got him! We got him!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus Hen, tumbling over the rail fence, was
wildly bellowing—with a pardonable extension
of the subject pronoun.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Hurrah!”</p>

<p class='c016'>You were on your feet in a twinkling, and
were dashing in the wake of Hen, up the incline,
midway of which, just below the stump, on his
side lay the woodchuck, limp and still.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen circumspectly reached and stirred him
with the tip of a toe; then, emboldened into the
attitude of Victor, recklessly kicked him.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He’s dead!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Je-rusalem! I should say he was!” you
agreed, poking the inert mass. “Wasn’t that
a dandy shot, though?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“You bet!” praised Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>And so it was—considering the attendant
circumstances.</p>

<p class='c016'>Gloatingly you and Hen examined your prize,
inch by inch, investigating him from his two
front teeth to his scraggly tail. Most of all did
you gloat upon the blood, striking proof of your
valor, and ere you had finished you well-nigh
could have drawn a diagram of the shot holes.</p>

<p class='c016'>’Twas established that the aim had been perfect
(yourself demonstrating to Hen precisely
what had been your course of action), that the
gun had shot tremendously, and that the woodchuck
was a very prodigy of size and strength.</p>

<p class='c016'>Poor ’chuck! He had made his last foray,
long enough had he dared to live, and now,
despite his cunning, he had fallen to a boy who
shut both eyes before firing.</p>

<p class='c016'>Homeward, is it? Certainly! Nothing is
left to be gained on the trail. With the stride
of conquerors, you and Hen march through the
village—you with gun and ammunition flasks,
Hen with the woodchuck, which he has appropriated,
dangling by the tail.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Well, well! Where did you get that fellow?”
query the men.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, John and me shot him,” explains Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Crickety, but ain’t he a big one! How’d
you get him?” query the boys.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We shot him! And he was runnin’, too!”
boasts Hen.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, you found him!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Didn’t neither—did we, John? You come
here and I’ll show you the shot holes in
him!”</p>

<p class='c016'>So, side by side, you and Hen gallantly
stepped, with the visible tokens of your calling,
homeward bound. At the entrance to your
alley, however, Hen inclined to lag; and as the
back yard was being traversed he fell further
behind. Your own pace was slower and less
confident, now.</p>

<p class='c016'>Hen flung you the woodchuck.</p>

<p class='c016'>“I’ve got to go,” he maintained. “You can
take him.”</p>

<p class='c016'>The back door opened, and mother stood and
gazed upon you, even as Hen was discreetly
retiring.</p>

<p class='c016'>“John!” she said. “What have you been
doing?”</p>

<p class='c016'>Beneath its powder grime your face paled.
At once you began to realize how your lip was
puffing, and how your shoulder was aching.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We were huntin’ woodchucks,” you quavered.</p>

<p class='c016'>“The idea!” said mother.</p>

<p class='c016'>“We got one, too,” you offered, in piteous
defense.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Mercy!” exclaimed mother, at the sight.
“Leave it right there, and come straight into
the house!”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ya-a-a!” bantered Hen, gleefully, from the
other side of the fence. “You’re goin’ to ketch
it!”</p>

<p class='c016'>Here the door closed behind you, shutting
you in with your shame.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch13' class='c006'>A BOY’S LOVES</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c015'>IN the utmost beginning of things—in that
time when roosters were very large, and
geese were very fierce, and only mother could
avert the thousand perils, heal
the thousand wounds—existed
a mythical partner
established in family annals
as “Your Little Sweetheart.”</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i277.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>“Annie? Don’t you remember
Annie! Why, she was
Your Little Sweetheart. You
used to play together day in
and day out. It was so cute
to see you!”</p>

<p class='c016'>But no. You may catch
here a bit of blue ribbon,
there an echo of a laugh,
yet, try as you will, you may
not recall her. Evidently when Your Little
Sweetheart Annie was put away along with
dresses and curls, she was put away so far that
she was lost forever.</p>

<p class='c016'>What space of months, or of years, elapses,
you cannot tell. Nevertheless, suddenly you
do witness yourself, still of age most immature,
(you recollect that somewhere in this period
you were miserably spelled down on “fish”),
laying votive offerings upon the desk of your
First Love, a girl with brown
eyes and rounded, rosy cheeks.</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i278.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>These offerings are in the
shape of bright pearl buttons
and carnelian pebbles.
The transfer requires much
breathless daring. Down the
aisle of the school-room you
march, your gift tightly clutched in your hand,
which swings carelessly by your side. Past her
seat you scuttle, and, without a single glance, you
leave the treasure upon the oaken top, beneath
her eyes. Away you hurry, affrighted, ashamed,
apprehensive, but hopeful. Presently, blushing,
from your seat you steal a look across at her.
She smiles roguishly. The offering is gone. It
is accepted; for she holds it up that you may
see. And you grin back, as red as a beet,
while your heart, exultant, goes thumpity,
thumpity, thumpity.</p>

<p class='c016'>In company with another boy, who must have
been a rival, you descry yourself hanging about
her gate, turning somersaults, wrestling, and
performing all kinds of monkey-shines, in the
brazen fancy that she may be peeking out of a
window and admiring you. She is framed, for
an instant, by the pane. You and he scamper
up and deposit in plain view—you upon the
right gate-post, he upon the left—a handful
apiece of hazelnuts. Then the pair of you
withdraw to a discreet distance and wait. Out
she trips, and gathers in your handful; but his
she disdainfully sweeps off upon the ground.</p>

<p class='c016'>He whooped in contempt and swaggered in
derision; and you—you—what was it you did?
Alas! the picture is cut here abruptly, as by a
knife; the First Love vanishes, and the Second
Love succeeds.</p>

<p class='c016'>She is the minister’s daughter, a gentle, winsome
little lass, not at all like the saucebox of
the brown eyes and the rich cheeks. In the
case of this Second Love there seems to have
been no studied wooing, no sheepish bribery by
pearl buttons and carnelians and nuts. You
fall in with each other as a matter of course.
In playing drop-the-handkerchief you nearly
always favor her, and she you; and when either
favors some one else the understanding between
you is perfect that this is done merely for the
sake of appearances.</p>

<p class='c016'>Your mutual affection is of the telepathic
order. Others in the party may romp and
squeal and shout in the moonlight, but you and
she sit together on the wheelbarrow, and look
on in tolerant, eloquent silence.</p>

<p class='c016'>In games you have occasionally kissed just
the tip of her ear, and that was sufficient.
Teasing companions may cry: “Aw, kiss her!
Fraidie! fraidie! <i>That</i> ain’t kissin’!” But you
know <i>she</i> knows, and smacks—those boisterous
smacks current in the realm—are superfluous.</p>

<p class='c016'>In addition to the kissing games, and the
state of exaltation upon the wheelbarrow, you
are able to conjure up yourself in another rôle:
at the frozen river’s edge, strapping on her
skates—your first remembered gallantry.</p>

<p class='c016'>Assailed by the shrill scoffings of your rude
comrades, under the refining influence of love
you kneel before her as she is struggling with a
stiff buckle. Like to the manner born, she
permits you to assist. Then—then you skated,
you and she, for each other’s sake enduring all
the pursuing gibes? This point is not clear.
You may not further linger with her, the minister’s
daughter, your Second Love, for in a hop,
skip, and jump you are worshiping at the skirts
of the Third Love.</p>

<p class='c016'>Her eyes are black—large and black. You
are desperately smitten. You live, move, and
have your being in a very ecstasy of fervor.</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i281.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Her name is Lillian. Somewhere, somehow,
you have run upon the lines
of Tennyson:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Airy, fairy Lilian,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Flitting, fairy Lilian,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>When I ask her if she love me,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Clasps her tiny hands above me;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>·&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;·</div>
      <div class='line in1'>She’ll not tell me if she love me,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Cruel little Lilian.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>They appeal to you. They
touch a spot which seems
not to be reached by even
Oliver Optic or “The Gorilla
Hunters.” You <i>must</i> have poetry, and you
memorize them, and repeat them over and over
to yourself, regardless of the fact that she, your
inspiration, is neither airy, fairy, nor flitting, but
of substantial, buxom proportions.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Third Love, with her bold black eyes
and her generous plumpness, is not so submissive
as was that gentle Second Love. She
flouts you. When the mood is upon her, she
makes faces at you. At a party, when you
stammer:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The stars are shining bright;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>May I see you home to-night?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c019'>as like as not she turns up her nose, or else she
tosses her head and snaps ungraciously: “Oh,
I s’pose so!”</p>

<p class='c016'>You never are sure of her; yet always you
find yourself meekly at her apron-strings.</p>

<p class='c016'>You willingly go to church (you conceive that
your family does not know why, but in this you
are much mistaken), because she sits in front of
you. What a blissful, comfortable feeling you
have, with her safely installed near at hand,
twitching her short braids not more than three
feet before your happy nose!</p>

<p class='c016'>When the pew is filled to overflowing, then,
sometimes, you are crowded out into her pew.
Embarrassed of mien, you decorously slide into
your new location, she receiving your presence
with a shrug and a sniff, and you growing redder
and redder as you imagine that all the congregation
must be reading your secret.</p>

<p class='c016'>In a moment she darts at you a sly glance
(the coquette! How vastly superior she is to
you in the wiles of love!), and you swell and
swell, until it seems to you that you are towering
into the raftered heights above.</p>

<p class='c016'>And at the conspicuousness thus entailed you
blush yet deeper.</p>

<p class='c016'>Ah, her folks are about to leave town; she is
to move away! The news comes with sickening
directness, and on top of the announcement she
pitilessly asserts that she is glad. You muster
courage to declare that you are “going to write.”
She flirts her bangs, and retorts grudgingly: “<i>I</i>
don’t care.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Which is all the good-by that you get.</p>

<p class='c016'>Beyond childish notes, you never have written
to a girl; and what a bothersome time this first
letter gives you! The chief trouble lies in the
start. “Dear Friend,” which appears to be the
address sanctioned by society, is too common-place
and formal; “Dear Lillian” may err in
the other direction, she is ridiculously touchy.
You want something unique, and in your researches
you encounter “Chérie”—where,
history reveals not.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Chérie” sounds nice; you do not know what
it means, but all the better, for consequently it
is finely ambiguous; and, proud of your originality,
you take it. Once started, you occupy
four pages, in your scrawling
script, with what you
deem to be clever badinage.
Badinage is the main conversational
stock in trade of
girl-and-boy days.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i284.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Principally you rail her
about a certain youth of
your town with whom she
used, to your torment, to
run races. You hope that she will reply in
a manner to convey that really she despised
that other chap and is longing for you.</p>

<p class='c016'>Two weeks of waiting. Then, one noon,
your father, with an arch remark, fishes from
an inside pocket a little square envelope, and
passes it to you, at the dinner-table. The
dinner-table, of all public places!</p>

<p class='c016'>You endeavor calmly to receive it with a
cursory glance; but you deposit it in your jacket
well aware that your trembling frame emanates
confusion.</p>

<p class='c016'>Having bolted your dinner, you retire to the
barn loft to revel in the missive. The double
sheet of miniature stationery has a rosebud
imprinted at the top.</p>

<p class='c016'>Alas! underneath are the thorns.</p>

<p class='c023'><span class='sc'>Friend Will</span>: No, I don’t have George
Brown to run races with any more, but I have
somebody lots better, and we run races every
night. Don’t you wish you knew who it was,
smartie?</p>

<p class='c019'>Even yet the lines rankle. They but indicate
the tenor of the whole letter—a letter from
which you failed, no matter how earnestly you
pored over it, to obtain one grain of comfort.</p>

<p class='c016'>You try her again, with another clumsy essay
at wit. Answer never comes, and for a while
you sneak about afraid that the truth will leak
out, and you be made a butt by your schoolmates.</p>

<p class='c016'>The queen is dead! Live the queen! This
Fourth Love is a “new girl,” a stranger who
one morn dawns upon your vision in the school-room.
She is an adorable creature, with blue
eyes, golden hair, and a bridling air that challenges
your attention. With joy you learn, at
home, that your folks know her folks; and when
your mother proposes that you go with her to
make a friendly call, so that “the little girl
won’t get lonesome for want of acquaintances,”
you accede unhesitatingly.</p>

<p class='c016'>You are presented at court, and, sitting with
her upon the sofa, do your best to be entertaining
while the elders chat about “help” and
church. You grasp, from her sprightly remarks,
that she is well accustomed to boy
admirers. She speaks of her “fellow”! She
writes to him! He “felt awful bad” to have
her leave! Beside hers, your experience in the
ways of the world—particularly boy-ways and
girl-ways, mingled—appears pitifully meager,
and beneath her assertions and giggling sallies
you are ofttimes ill at ease.</p>

<p class='c016'>Impressed with her value, you depart, escorting
your mother; and that night, before you go
to sleep, you firmly resolve to win this girl or
perish.</p>

<p class='c016'>The Fourth Love resolves into a sad thing of
mawkish sentiment. You are not given to
mooning or spooning. You are too healthy.
Drop-the-handkerchief, clap-in and clap-out,
post-office—these tumultuous kissing games,
open and aboveboard, are the alpha and omega
of the caresses in your set. However, the new
girl instils another element,
hitherto foreign to the social
intercourse.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i287.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>To-day you recall, with
great vividness, that winter
evening before supper, when
you lingered, on your way
home, in the front hall at
her house, planning with
her to go skating.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, isn’t it dark!” she piped suddenly. “I
can’t see you at all.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“And I can’t see you, either,” you responded.</p>

<p class='c016'>Silence.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Where are you?” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Oh, I’m here by the door. Are you ’fraid?”
you bantered innocently.</p>

<p class='c016'>Silence.</p>

<p class='c016'>“S’posing you kissed me! Wouldn’t that be
awful!” she tittered in pretended horror.</p>

<p class='c016'>But you—you summoned your chivalry, and
went forth secure in the knowledge that you
had not taken advantage of her helplessness.</p>

<p class='c016'>This was the end. From that evening dated
her coldness. Another boy jumped in and
supplanted you. You encountered them together,
and they looked upon you and laughed.
He informed you that she said you “hadn’t any
sense.” You sent back a counter-accusation,
which he gladly reported. But enough; away
with this Eve. What becomes of her you are
able to decipher not. Let us consider the Fifth
Love.</p>

<p class='c016'>Her you acquire deliberately, with purpose
aforethought, so to speak. A love is now absolutely
necessary to you, and casting about, you
hit upon the girl across the street. You have
known her virtually all your life. She is not
very pretty; she is just a plain, jolly, wholesome
lassie, who is continually running over to your
house, and with whom you are as free as with
your own sister; but she will do.</p>

<p class='c016'>Forthwith you begin a campaign. You walk
home with her; you lend her books; you take
her riding—a real, ceremonious ride, and not,
as formerly, merely a lift down-town; you strive
as hard as you can to enthuse over her and
remark beauties in her. And she, meantime a
little flustered and astonished at your unwonted
assiduousness, accepts your crafty attentions
and frankly confides to your sister that she
wishes <i>she</i> had a brother.</p>

<p class='c016'>Unsuspicious girl! She treats you with a
camaraderie which should warn you, but which
only proves your undoing.</p>

<p class='c016'>Mindful of the lesson gained at the hands of
the Fourth Love, she the sentimental, you resolve
that you will not be classed, in this present
instance, as having “no sense.” Accordingly,
one evening, upon parting with the Fifth Love
at her gate, you baldly propose—well, you
blurt awkwardly:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Let’s kiss good night.”</p>

<p class='c016'>With what scorn she spurns the suggestion!
Then, while your ears are afire and you hang
your head, she administers a severe, virtuous
lecture upon the impropriety of an act such as
you mention.</p>

<p class='c016'>“But lots of boys and girls do it,” you hazard.</p>

<p class='c016'>She does not believe you; and, anyway, <i>she</i>
never would. And she packs you home.
You trudge across the street, angry, irritated,
abashed, uncertain as to whether she was
hoaxing you or whether she was sincere.</p>

<p class='c016'>Girls are the <i>darndest</i> creatures!</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>
<img src='images/i290.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>Evidently here closes the episode of the Fifth
Love. It was but natural that thereafter you
should be rather disconcerted when in her
presence; and although she
might act as if nothing had
happened, <i>you</i> (plagued unmercifully
by your sister)
could not forget.</p>

<p class='c016'>And the Sixth Love? Yes,
she followed, with scarce a
decent interval, hard upon
the exit of the all too high-minded Fifth.
Maybe it was in a spirit of pique that you
sought her. Whatever the preliminary circumstance,
regard yourself eventually head over
heels again, immersed in the current of a passion
equaled only by your affair with that
Third Love—“cruel little Lilian.”</p>

<p class='c016'>This Sixth Love, too, has black eyes and an
engaging plumpness. Black eyes, apparently,
are the eyes most fatal to you. For the Sixth
Love you would unflinchingly die, if life without
her were the alternative; and you picture to
yourself the manner in which she would mourn
(you hope) when you are lying cold and still,
with just your white face showing, in the family
parlor.</p>

<p class='c016'>No matter how circuitous it makes your
route, going and coming you
always manage to pass her
house.</p>

<div  class='figright id005'>
<img src='images/i291.jpg' alt='' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c016'>You wonder if she is proud
of you because you can throw
a curve. You would like to
have her see that you are
strong, and skilled in all the
exercises to which boys are
heir. You want to be her
ideal, her knight. Some
times you suspect that she
does not thoroughly appreciate your prowess
and good points, for she prates of other boys
who do so and so, whereas you can easily do
as much and more.</p>

<p class='c016'>Now, whether or not it was due to the snake-curves
(every boy is positive, soon or late, that
he can throw a snake-curve), looking back you
behold yourself possessed at last of this maiden
of your choice. Of course no word of love has
been uttered between you. That would be too
silly and theatrical, almost morbid; furthermore,
it is unnecessary. She has shyly confessed to
you that she “likes” you, and this is sufficient.
You generously refrain from urging her beyond
this maiden admission.</p>

<p class='c016'>Aye, ’tis distance lends enchantment to the
view! You have been so accustomed to the
excitement of the chase that with idleness you
wax restive. The Sixth Love verges upon being
a nuisance. Her black eyes, beaming for you
alone, pall upon you. You grow callous toward
her. You tire of always having her choose you
at parties; you tire of her eternal assumption of
proprietorship over you; you wish that she
would not come so much to see your sister, and
thrust herself upon you in your home.</p>

<p class='c016'>And you set out to shake her off; you skip
by the back door as she enters by the front;
you avoid her at parties; you show her, in a
dozen ways, that you do not fancy her any more.</p>

<p class='c016'>Poor anxious, forsaken Sixth Love! It is she
who turns the wooer; it is she who passes and
repasses <i>your</i> house; it is she who haunts <i>your</i>
steps, hoping that she may catch a glimpse of
you. Regardless of the fact that you yourself
so often have played this game, you remain
obdurate. Finally pride rises to her rescue, and
she sends notice that she “hates you.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Pooh! Who cares!” you sniff, with a curl
of the lip.</p>

<p class='c016'>Thus lapses behind you the Sixth Love; and
although you have a faint vision of her parading,
to meet your eyes, your most despised enemy,
whom, in bravado, she had immediately adopted,
memory indicates that you were unaffected by
the sight, save to sneer, and that already the
Seventh Love was engrossing your attention.</p>

<p class='c016'>For there was a Seventh Love, and an Eighth,
and more besides, to constitute a long train of
wee, innocent heart-troubles as evanescent as a
dream, but at their time just as real; until from
this series of shallow, dancing ripples of Boy’s
Love, lo! one day you suddenly emerged upon
the deep ocean of Man’s Love, and anchored in
the quiet haven where She awaited—She, the
gracious embodiment of the best in these her
girlish predecessors.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='ch14' class='c006'>NOON</h2>
</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_6_0_65 c015'>AFTER all, it is no fun posing at being a
man. It is not, as you would inform the
other boys, the pleasant sinecure that it is currently
presumed to be, amongst your kind.
The picture has more depth than appears at
the distance. As you approach, you note only
the surface tints; but when you have arrived,
then begin to unfold aspects previously quite
unsuspected.</p>

<p class='c016'>So now, having had experience, you fain
would turn back, and doffing for all time those
starchy, heavy, strait-jacket garments which
you have mistakenly donned, you would resume
the free-and-easy blouse and knickerbockers
and tattered brim, and would rejoin
your gay brethren of school and vacation. You
have learned your lesson, and you will leave
them no more.</p>

<p class='c016'>So be it. But alas, unavailingly you stop on
your way down-town, beside the vacant lot
where the other boys are playing ball, and look
wistfully in upon them. None yells:</p>

<p class='c016'>“Come on, Jocko. You’re tenth fielder.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Once the ball rolls your way. You toss it
back—toss it awkwardly, somehow, proving
that you are out of practice. However, you
can limber up right speedily. You have been
away, they should know.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Aw, you’re out! You’re out! You are too!
Ask that man. He’s out, ain’t he, Mister?”</p>

<p class='c016'>You wait for “that man,” wherever he may
be, to reply. But you yourself are the sole
spectator, and you gaze right and left, puzzled.</p>

<p class='c016'>“He’s out—ain’t he!”</p>

<p class='c016'><i>You!</i> It is you to whom they are appealing!
You nod, confusedly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Ya-a-a! The man says you’re out!”</p>

<p class='c016'>The man! The word gives you a little shock.
They are styling you “man”! A sensation of
disappointment and surprise sweeps through
you; here you are, Rip Van Winkle, whom
nobody knows. If only these your former
cronies might see through and recognize what
lies behind this thin disguise, they would realize
that you really are but ten, and one of them.</p>

<p class='c016'>All in the broad sun the other boys are “goin’
fishin’.” It is a prime day. Your being tingles
for the poise of the trusty old pole upon your
shoulder, and the feel of the fat bait-can in
your jacket pocket. Hang business! You repudiate
its tyranny. That “engagement” may
importune, in vain. The perch are running,
the kids are “all catchin’ ’em,” “fishin’” is
“dandy.” Hurrah! The old-time <i>wanderlust</i>
is stirring in your veins. You will go. But—something
holds you back. It will not be much
fun to fish alone. Something tells you that
even though you “fire” your shoes and stockings
and strip to shirt and trousers, and boldly enter
the fray, still will you be an alien, and looked
upon askance. You are a “man,” and perch
and bullheads are not for the likes of you.</p>

<p class='c016'>Nevertheless, you can try. There hastens
Hen—or, at least, one who might be Hen—pattering
down the street, all accoutered for the
ranks of joy and rivalry.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Goin’ fishin’?” you demand bluffly.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Sir!” In a word has he relegated you to
your place. He knows you—knows that you
have no fish-worms in your pocket, and that to
match his mighty pole you have only a paltry
jointed “rod.”</p>

<p class='c016'>He pauses impatiently. He has little time
to waste with you.</p>

<p class='c016'>“Any good?”</p>

<p class='c016'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Irksomely respectful, now with a wriggle he
is off, onward into his magic realms, leaving
you to gaze after, chastened, chagrined.</p>

<p class='c016'>Oh, this hideous disguise—this iron metamorphosis
which wizard Time, the inexorable,
has laid upon you! There is no dropping it.</p>

<p class='c016'>You turn to Nature; surely Nature has the
acumen to recognize that you have grown not
at all, save, perhaps, in stature. But the sun
burns, the rain wets, the snow chills—each
uncompromising and austere. The pond that
once stretched away like an ocean shrinks and
shallows at your coming, till you can almost
step from bank to bank; the once limitless wood,
as wild and as romantic as the Carpathians,
mischievously contracts so that you can see
through from side to side; the highroad is dusty,
and the paths refuse to lead, but are finished
in a stride. Everything conspires to remind
you that you are foreign, Brobdingnagian, a
personage apart, and that too late have you
faced about.</p>

<p class='c016'>To the pleasures and to the favors that were
you have forfeited the “Open, sesame!”</p>

<p class='c016'>You may not reinstate yourself by the company
that you keep, for the company of old—where
is it? Vanished; changed, like yourself;
resistlessly urged on and ever on by the current
which there is no stemming. Hen is a “man”—he
runs a grocery store. Billy Lunt is a
“man”—and an M.D., to boot. “Fat” Day
is a “man”—even an alderman. “Snoopie”
Mitchell, aye, the independent, envied Snoopie,
whom naught, you believed, could coerce, is a
“man”—for sometimes you are whirled along
behind his engine. They all seem to glory in
their estate and its attributes. And to them,
<i>you</i> are a “man.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Exists only one authority to support your
quest of boyhood; only one heart, besides your
own, which apparently would be glad to have
you again in blouse and knickerbockers; and
to her you are still a boy, with the freckles concealed,
merely, by that pointed beard at which
she gently rails even in her pride. Mother!
You can depend upon mother, as of yore. She
is no older, herself; she is the same. Mother
never changes. You are no older, yourself;
you are the same. Let the other boys call you
“man” and say “sir”; let sun and rain and
snow, and pond and wood and path, deny you
their one-time hospitality. To all the world
without you may be a “man,” but to mother
you are her “boy.”</p>

<p class='c016'>Yet Time, forsooth, wrests even this anchorage
from you. Comes an hour when, confronted
by the inevitable, helpless in its grip, unreconciled
even in your resignation, you dully stand
by a bedside and wait—wait—wait.</p>

<p class='c016'>Suddenly the eyes open and look up into
yours with understanding. The graying, wrinkled
face faintly smiles.</p>

<p class='c016'>“What a great big boy you are getting to be,
Johnny,” she murmurs, in vague surprise.</p>

<p class='c016'>That is all. She is gone, and with her departs
your last hold upon the things that were. Your
morning is passed forever. It is noon. You
must turn away, irrevocably the man.</p>

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
